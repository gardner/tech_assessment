The Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019 (NTLDM) and associated practice notes
replaced the Nelson Land Development Manual 2010 on 1 July 2019.


Plan Change 27 updated the Nelson Resource Management Plan as follows:


a. Externally referencing the Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019, and specific

chapters of the NTLDM, where relevant, throughout the Nelson Resource Management
Plan, in doing so replacing all references to the Nelson City Council Land Development
Manual 2010 as a means of ascertaining consent status, and as matters for control or
discretion, or as assessment criteria for certain activities including, but not limited to,
subdivisions.


b. Revising the building over or alongside drains rule where it appears in the Nelson

Resource Management Plan Zone chapters, the effect of which is to:


i. alter the consent status of some contravening activities from controlled activities
to restricted discretionary activities;


ii. make any building within 3m of the top of a bank of an open drain a discretionary

activity; and


iii. make the rule operate in a standalone manner, independent of the NTLDM.


Internal Document ID: A2509507


c. Consequential amendments to the Nelson Resource Management Plan.


**2.** **Implementation of Policy 11(a) of the National Policy Statement for Urban**

**Development 2020 (NPSUD 2020)**


The NPSUD 2020 contains multiple objectives that aim to support well-functioning, high
amenity, urban environments that support growth. Policy 11 (a) facilitates a reduction in
private motor car dominance within urban areas by eliminating parking rate minimum
standards from district plans.

standards from the Nelson Resource Management Plan.


The NRMP has been updated to give effect to these instructions.

**5.** **Amendment of minor error – DO18.1.4**
