Context


During 2021 and 2022, Nelson
City Council and Tasman District
Council (together, the Shareholders)
investigated the incorporation of a
holding company that they would
own in equal shares. The holding
company would hold and administer
investments in entities in which the

Shareholders have a substantial
interest for the benefit of the Nelson
and Tasman regions, being Port
Nelson Limited (Port Nelson) and
Nelson Airport Limited (Nelson
Airport).


In 2022 the Shareholders resolved to incorporate
Infrastructure Holdings Limited (IHL or Parent).


Owned equally by Nelson City Council (NCC) and
Tasman District Council (TDC), IHL is the investment
arm for Port Nelson and Nelson Airport (together, the
Group).


IHL is recognised as a council-controlled trading
organisation (CCTO) for the purposes of the Local

Government Act 2002.



**Statement of Intent Structure**


This Statement of Intent (SoI) represents the first for
IHL. It is prepared in accordance with Section 64(1) of
the Local Government Act 2002 for the period 1 July

2023 to 30 June 2026.


The SoI sets out the Group’s objectives, the nature
and scope of the activities to be undertaken, and the
performance measures and targets by which the
Group’s performance may be assessed in relation to
its objectives.


The Statement of Corporate Intent (SoCI) for Port
Nelson and the SoI for Nelson Airport are attached
as appendices. The IHL board has determined that

it should not rewrite the information contained in

these documents but rather present it in full, as
the relevant subsidiary boards have approved.
Consequently, the IHL board recommends that
readers consider the material in the appendices as
integral to this SoI.


Port Nelson and the Nelson Airport will continue to
have an ongoing statutory obligation to prepare a

SoCI and SoI.

economy. Its primary service is moving people into
and out from the region safely and efficiently.


Nelson Airport supports a diverse range of
businesses that service passengers or require
access to air services or airport land and building

infrastructure.

Distribution to Shareholders


The IHL board will pay dividends to the shareholders
after considering its profitability, debt levels, future
investment requirements and the requirement to
meet the solvency test under the provisions of the
Companies Act 1993.


The IHL Board will develop and implement a formal
IHL dividend policy during 24FY.

Commercial Valuation


The directors consider the commercial value of

the shareholders’ investment in IHL to be not less

than the shareholders’ funds as disclosed in the

Statement of Financial Position published in the
annual report.


Using accepted valuation methodologies,

Directors will consider the commercial valuation

of IHL annually, and where directors determine it
is necessary, a reassessment of the value of the
shareholders’ investment in IHL may be undertaken.


**13** S T AT EM ENT OF I N T E N T 2 0 2 4 - 2 6 NDOCS-1511110536-748


Acquisition and Divestment



In relation to the potential acquisition or divestment
of assets/investments (i.e., equity interests, shares, or
equivalent) held directly by IHL (parent entity), IHL will
seek shareholder approval of any transaction which
results in a significant change to the ownership
interest held by IHL.


Subsidiary of IHL


In relation to the potential acquisition or divestment
of assets/investments (i.e., equity interests, shares, or
equivalent) by a subsidiary of IHL, IHL will adopt the
following approach:


i. If the transaction is a major transaction (as
defined by the Companies Act), IHL will consider the
proposal, and as the shareholder of the subsidiary,
IHL is required to either approve or not approve the
transaction. IHL will consult with shareholders prior to
determining whether or not to approve the proposed

transaction.



ii. If the transaction is material but not a major
transaction, IHL will request that the subsidiary
companies consult with IHL before entering into the
proposed transaction. IHL will inform shareholders
under the “no surprises” policy.


iii. If the transaction otherwise requires shareholder
approval from IHL, IHL will assess the transaction
and determine whether or not to approve it. IHL will
keep shareholders informed under the “no surprises”
policy.


iv. Before a council-controlled organisation makes a
decision that may significantly affect land or a body
of water, it must consider the relationship of Māori

and their culture and traditions with their ancestral
land, water, sites, wāhi tapu, valued flora and fauna,
and other taonga.



Compensatory Activities


Currently, there are no activities for which
compensation will be sought from any local
authority. On 1 July 2023, the shareholders will have
uncalled capital of up to $233 million. There is no
current intention to make a call on any uncalled
capital.


**14** S T AT EM ENT OF I N T E N T 2 0 2 4 - 2 6 NDOCS-1511110536-748


Risk Management


In relation to corporate treasury risk management at
the parent level, IHL has recognised funding, liquidity,
interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price

risk.


IHL has adopted a Group Treasury Policy that
recognises each of these corporate treasury risks
and determined specific mitigation strategies.


Funding risk management focuses on ensuring debt
funding can be raised or refinanced in the future at
an acceptable price and tenor. At a single point in
time, credit markets may be constrained or offered
pricing levels may be less than optimal.


The Group’s sources of debt funding are limited to
Local Government Funding Agency (“LGFA”) and
Board-approved banks. While it is the intention of
the Group to fund core debt requirements through
LGFA, relationships with approved banks must be
maintained for the provision of transactional, liquidity
and working capital funding requirements.


A key control of funding risk management is to
spread and smooth debt maturities.


Liquidity risk management involves ensuring that
cash requirements can be met as they arise.
This risk can be effectively mitigated through the



measurement, management, and maintenance of
the liquidity ratio, along with efficient and effective
cash management.


Interest rate risk is the risk that borrowing costs (due
to movements in market wholesale interest rates) will
materially exceed the Group’s business plans.


The primary objective of interest rate risk
management is to reduce uncertainty relating to
wholesale interest rate movements through the fixing
and/or hedging of interest costs. Certainty around
interest costs is to be achieved through the proactive
management of underlying interest rate exposures in
accordance with the prescribed debt maturity profile
and parameters.


Foreign exchange risk is the risk that exchange
rate movements will lead to NZD cash flows that
materially differ from budgeted forecasts and
approved capital plans.


Individual subsidiary foreign currency exposures
greater than NZD100,000 are to be hedged.
Commodity price risk is where movements in
international commodity prices (i.e. diesel) will result
in NZD purchase costs that materially differ from
budgeted amounts.

Sustainability and Climate Change



Sustainability and Climate Resilience


IHL recognises its responsibility to demonstrate
leadership in showing commitment to sustainability
and climate resilience planning.


IHL expects to set and attain sustainability and
climate performance objectives that are compatible
with the IHL Group companies’ activities, commercial
nature and other objectives.


Carbon reduction


Port Nelson is a member of the Climate Leaders

Coalition and has set targets to reduce their carbon
emissions in support of the coalition’s goal of limiting
global warming to 1.5 degrees.


Independent verification of Port Nelson’s and Nelson
Airport’s performance against their carbon reduction
targets will be provided by an accredited third party.



2024FY projects underway to recognise and address
climate change:


Port Nelson and Nelson Airport are currently working
on various projects to increase their resilience
against natural disasters and reduce carbon
emissions, including those expected to be caused by
climate change. These projects are outlined in their
SoCI and SoI respectively.


Climate-Related Disclosure Reporting


Consistent with the requirements of Council
Shareholders, IHL will commence reporting against
the Climate-Related Disclosures (NZ CS 1) Standard

in 2024.


Over three years, the reporting will be matured
through three phases: scoping, qualitative and
quantitative compliance, with full compliance in

2026FY.


The table on the following page provides an overview
of IHL’s Climate-Related Disclosure Reporting timeline
for implementation.

People and Health and Safety



IHL recognises the requirement for it to be a good
employer.


In collaboration with Port Nelson and Nelson Airport,
IHL intends to develop principles and objectives at a
Group level to ensure the health, safety and
wellbeing of all people working across the Group. It
is not intended that IHL will employ people directly



in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, as part of its
people plans, it aims to develop governance best
practices and talent for the benefit of the region.


Port Nelson and Nelson Airport address specific risks,
including health and safety risks in their respective

SoCI and SoI.

Approach to Governance



IHL discharges its role in relation to its objectives
through a variety of means, including:


Board Charter


It is the intention of the IHL board to develop and
implement a board charter in 24FY. The board

charter will include how IHL intends to use board

sub-committees and the relevant terms of reference.


Appointment of directors


Shareholders select and appoint directors to IHL.


IHL selects and appoints all directors to its
subsidiaries following receiving a recommendation
from the Governance and Appointment Committee
of IHL. Each Shareholder is entitled to appoint one
member to the Governance and Appointments

Committee


Letters of Expectation


Sent by IHL to each subsidiary each year, setting out
IHL’s shareholder expectations for the subsidiaries’
scope of activity and financial performance.



Statement of Intent


Each subsidiary is required to produce an annual SoI
setting out its operational and financial intentions
and key performance measures in respect on which
the subsidiary is monitored.


Monitoring


Subsidiaries will provide regular updates to IHL which
include financial, strategic, risk and operational
updates for any given period. Financial reporting is
required semi-annually for consolidated reporting
purposes, with audited financial reporting required
annually.


Group Collaboration


IHL will provide debt funding to subsidiaries within the
Group through the IHL Intra Group Funding Facility
(IGFF), which utilises IHL’s access to cost effective
debt funding for the Group.

by council shareholders to Infrastructure Holdings

Limited (IHL) on 22 December 2022.

Nature and Scope of Activities


Port Nelson is the maritime gateway
for Te Tauihu – a vital hub for

economic activity and a key facilitator
of our region’s continued growth and
prosperity.



Import/Export Mix



Port Nelson is an international port located in the city

of Nelson and is owned by Infrastructure Holdings

Ltd which is in turn equally owned by both Nelson City

Council and Tasman District Council. The rich history of

Port Nelson has helped shape the vibrant ‘gateway to

the world’. Early accounts of Wakatū (Nelson) - means

a ‘standing place or shelter for canoes’- described the
area’s rich history for Māori trading fish and produce.

Since the establishment of the Port Nelson Harbour

Board in 1901, Port Nelson has welcomed visitors

and commercial traders to Te Tauihu and, to this day,

continues to respond to its customers’ and community’s

needs. The Port handles a wide variety of cargo,

including containerised cargo and bulk cargo.


Approximately 67% of Port Nelson’s volumes are

exported and 33% are imported. Major export

commodities include forestry products (logs, sawn

and processed timber), seafood, pip fruit and wine.

Port Nelson is the largest seafood processing port in

Australasia, supporting and catering to the needs of

some of New Zealand’s main seafood companies and
associated fishing fleets. The Port also houses one of
New Zealand’s largest marine service sectors. Nelson/

Tasman is the second-largest apple growing region

in the country, with approximately 28% of the total

apple crop being grown here and exported around the

world. Approximately 70% of New Zealand’s wine is

produced in Marlborough, making Port Nelson a vital

link in the wine industry’s supply chain. The main import

commodities to Port Nelson are fuel and vehicles, both

second-hand and new.


Since the Port has been established, it has undergone
significant expansions and upgrades to accommodate
the growing demand for its services. In recent years,

Port Nelson has been investing in infrastructure and
plant to improve efficiency and capacity.



The Port has also focused on diversifying its services,

including offering warehousing and logistics services.


Port Nelson creates value for its customers by providing

a suite of marine, cargo handling, warehousing, logistic,

slipway, and property portfolio services. Marine services

include–pilotage, towage, navigation aids, and the

berthing, and departure of vessels. The Port operates

three tugs and maintains a dredged channel to allow

vessels up to 260m in length to access the Port. Cargo

handling services include the unloading, temporary

storage, and loading of many forms of cargo including

containers, logs, cars, fertiliser, cement, methanol, and

fuel.


Logistics and warehousing services are provided

through our QuayConnect and QuayPack businesses.

QuayConnect works with on-site 3PL partner QuayPack

to offer integrated transport and third-party logistics

(3PL) storage solutions to our customers. The Port
utilises 23,000m² of British Retail Consortium accredited

storage facilities, at the Patterson Logistics Centre, New

Zealand’s largest on-port storage facility, and has a

dedicated and scheduled trucking service. QuayConnect
enables the efficient connection of products to market.


Port Nelson’s scope of services also includes slipway

services for vessels up to 2,400t. This facility supports

one of New Zealand’s strongest marine engineering

clusters. In addition, the Port has over 235,000 m2 of

commercial land that it develops and leases to support
the fishing, marine services, and other export-related

industries.

Stakeholders and Goals


Port Nelson’s purpose is ‘to facilitate
regional prosperity/kia āhei ki te kōkiri
whakamua ki te taumata ā-rohe’


A key word in our purpose is ‘prosperity’. While

traditionally seen from an economic perspective, the

Port recognises that sustainable prosperity comes

from addressing the needs of all its stakeholders.


The Port has consolidated its stakeholders into five
groups: Customers, Environment, People, Community,



and Shareholders. The Port’s focus on its multiple

stakeholders has resulted in a commitment to report

its results under each stakeholder through its

integrated reporting framework.


The Port also defines what success looks like from
each stakeholder’s perspective and has established
long term goals that reflect that understanding. The
simple days of ‘or’ – profit or environment; customer
or community; profit or safety are gone. Businesses
today must embrace the ‘and’.


























**Customers**

_Ō tātou_


_kiritaki_


Providing leading port operations
and driving supply chain innovation is
integral to ensure the Port can continue
to generate a successful operation and
in turn deliver strong financial returns.


Port Nelson has two types of customers: those that

contract directly with the Port and those that export or

import through the Port via contracts with third parties.



The cargo across Port Nelson reflects the activities of
Te Tauihu. Export crops dominate this cargo,including:

logs, fruit, wine, processed timber, and seafood. Typical

of a regional port in New Zealand, exports dominate

imports. From a cargo perspective, the graphs below

describe the make up of our cargo, including the recent

history of activity and three year forecast.

**Environment**


_Tō tātou_


_taiao_



The Port aims to be a leader

in sustainable environmental

management in the New Zealand
port industry by reducing our
environmental impacts and pushing
towards a sustainable future.



The Port is committed to continual improvement in its

environmental performance. Fuel is consumed directly

by tugs, cranes, material handling equipment, and port

users: trucks and ships, this creates carbon emissions.

In addition, the Port’s activities create negative physical

emissions in the form of noise, dust, stormwater runoff,

and the potential for spillage. Reducing these impacts

are a priority for the Port.

**Our People**

_Ō tātou_

_whānau_


Port Nelson is proud of its workforce
and is committed to building and
keeping safe an engaged highperforming team.


Port Nelson aims to attract and retain a diverse, and

motivated workforce supported by a highly capable

and trained leadership team. Port Nelson invests
significantly in training, health and safety and wellbeing.
Our people are critical to running a successful business

and our objectives are to retain talent and cultivate a

progressive workplace.


Over 300 people are employed in the Port team. As

Port Nelson is a 24/7 business, the working pattern

is primarily driven by the tidal nature of the Port and

the intermittent movements of international vessels.

This means that a number of our workers are casual

workers, making the full-time equivalent (FTE) count

approximately 230.


Port Nelson has a strong emphasis on health, safety
and wellbeing and continues to invest significant
resources in this area. With large machines, work over
water, stacked cargo, multiple traffic flows, and work in
confined spaces, the risks in the work environment are
real. The Port is proud of the focus and commitment of

the entire team to safety however, there is an ongoing

drive for improvements. Key health and safety metrics

are provided in the performance target table.

_Ō tātou_

Commercial success is critically
important to the Port as it provides a
return for our shareholders investment

and delivers a strong dividend to our
community.


The Port’s current level of economic performance,

measured by return on assets and return on equity,

does not give shareholders a fair return on their

investment. To sustain strong dividends to our

community and investment in infrastructure into the

future, the level of economic performance needs to

improve. To this end, work is underway to review the

Port’s economic model.


The Port looks to sustain and modernise its

infrastructure by completing an Infrastructure

Masterplan to ensure optimal investment and resilience

for the Port’s infrastructure and assets into 2050.



The Port also continues to build on its Asset

Management approach by ensuring it has systematic

processes for developing, operating, maintaining,

upgrading, and disposing of assets in the most cost
effective manner.


Technology is a key factor in the success and efficiency
of Port Nelson, as it helps to streamline processes,

improve communication and coordination, enhance

safety and security, and provide real-time data analysis

for better decision-making. By leveraging technology,

Port Nelson optimises its operations and improves its
competitiveness, leading to a more efficient, safe, and
secure port environment. Technology also enables

the integration of various systems and the sharing

of information across the supply chain, resulting
in increased visibility and efficiency. The adoption
of technology at Port Nelson helps to keep the port

improving its operations and ensuring its continued

success.



The graph below shows Port Nelson’s profitability
historically and forecasts until the 2026 financial year.


*Underlying profit excludes revaluation of investment properties.

Risk Management


Risk management forms a part of every
aspect of the Port’s operations. This
ranges from daily toolbox sessions, to
job specific assessments, through to
capital funding requests and ultimately
our long term strategic plan.


Formal company wide risk reviews are undertaken

quarterly. These reviews are discussed at board

meetings, with a focus on the top 20 risks. In addition,

detailed reviews of individual top risks are also covered

at Board meetings.



The Finance and Risk Committee takes responsibility

for ensuring that the risk management process is
appropriate, providing an oversight of financial risks
and ensuring risk reporting up to the full Board is

effective. A recently completed external review has

provided a path for further improvements of risk

management and internal auditing.


In addition to operational and strategic risks, the

company wide risks include natural hazards, such as

earthquakes, tsunami and storms, as well as climate

change risk.


The Port is not required to report under the Climate
related disclosures and Other Matters Amendment Bill.

However, it is the intention of the Port to commence

reporting against the climate-related disclosures

standard in 2024FY, with full compliance in 2026FY.

Sustainability and Climate
Change



The Port is committed to reducing its
impact on the environment, including
its contribution to climate change, as
well as providing transparency to the
Community on the potential impacts of
climate change on Port operations.


Carbon reduction:


The Port has established two key targets for carbon

reduction:


- 67% reduction of gross carbon emissions from

2019FY to 2035FY, and;


- Net zero carbon emissions by 2050


The first target aligns with the Climate Leaders
Coalition goal of contributing to holding global warming
to 1.5 degrees. Independent verification of the Ports
performance against this target will be provided by

Toitu. Achieving this result for Scope 1 and 2 emissions

requires the Port to transition to electric cranes and

alternate fuels (e.g. hydrogen) for our heavy plant.


Climate change:


A preliminary review of the impacts of climate

change on the Port was undertaken in 2022 through

the consultancy, Deloitte. This work built on a Port
Resilience Review completed in 2021 that identified
the physical risks to the Port from natural events and

climate change related impacts. The Infrastructure

Masterplan currently being completed will focus on the

next 30 years and will identify adaptation works that will

need to be provided over this period.


Waste minimisation:


With a strengthened environmental team in 2024, the
Port will focus on diverting waste from landfill through
reducing waste and increasing recycling, this being

pursued as part of an initiative to engage more deeply

with the wider Port team to establish environmental

champions and raise the priority of environmental

management matters.



Climate related disclosures:


Consistent with the requirements of Council

Shareholders and Infrastructure Holding Limited

(IHL), the Port will commence reporting against the

climate-related Disclosures (NZ CS 1) standard in 2024.

The reporting will be matured through three phases:

scoping, qualitative and quantitative compliance over

three years, with full compliance in 2026FY.


2024FY projects underway to recognise and address

climate change:


- Replacement of diesel cranes with electric cranes:

The Port will scope in 2024 for its next replacement
crane to be an electric diesel / hybrid. This move will
require an upgrade to the electrical infrastructure on
the site. The new crane will be the first electric port
mobile crane in NZ.


- Hydrogen injection into heavy container mover plant:

A trial injecting hydrogen into one of our container
movers will be commenced in 2024. An expected
reduction in fuel burn of 15% is targeted.


- Speed reduction in the operational Port areas:

Operational speeds have been reduced in the Port
Operational area from 25 kmph to 20 kmph. This has
the benefit of safety improvements and fuel reduction.


- Plant utilisation and optimised operator performance:

Installation of monitors into moving heavy plant will
take place in 2024FY to inform on areas for fuel
conservation.


- Independent verification of carbon reporting: Through

Toitu, the Port will establish independent verification
of its carbon emissions, as well as certification of its
carbon reduction plans and projections.


- Reduction on waste: A waste audit will be undertaken


in 2024 and initiatives commenced to reduce waste
going to landfill.


- Infrastructure Masterplan to address climate

change adaptation: An Infrastructure Masterplan
will be completed in early FY2024, this will provide a
framework for the Port’s physical response to climate
change.


- Sea-grass regeneration: The Port will continue

to sponsor research by Cawthron into sea-grass
regeneration, recognizing the blue carbon benefits of
sea-grass.

Health and Safety


Port Nelson has a responsibility to
manage health, safety and wellbeing
risks and provide a safe and healthy
work environment for every person
coming onto a port site.


Port Nelson operates under a health and safety

management plan which provides the Port with systems

and processes that form the foundation to ensure we

have a safe work environment. A key part of this plan

is to enable our systems and processes to be improved

through active engagement.


Every position at Port Nelson has a responsibility for

health and safety. The Port also has a responsibility to

ensure every worker has a clear understanding of risks

associated with their work as well as the associated

controls. A structured network of work group meetings

ensures engagement, continued focus, and access to

data and training.



Port Nelson, through consultation with our people, has
identified 7 critical risks that have the potential to cause

fatalities, this translates to 42 risk events where a

critical risk is being managed. Critical Risk Reviews, an

improvement review process, ensures the controls the

Port has in place are working, and if not, improve and

add new ones.


Port Nelson’s board is engaged in setting policies and

ensuring compliance through the health and safety

sub-committee. External audits are used to challenge

current operations. The Port developed a plan based
on the outcomes from the 2023 financial year SafePlus
external audit. The Port is currently aligning its systems

to ISO 45001, an international standard for health and

safety at work developed by national and international

standards committees independent of government.

continues to build and maintain positive relationships

with the community through a multi-faceted approach.

This includes a Port Noise Liaison Committee,

Environmental Management Committee and active

sponsorship. Members of the community are also

provided with the opportunity to be informed about

Port activities through the Port Nelson website, contact

forms, social media,,and our twice-yearly newsletter:

the Port will implement its 3-5 year Māori Strategy

and Action Plan. The Māori Strategy and Action Plan

focuses on the important work of improving and

strengthening our relationships with tangata whenua

and mana whenua. This includes engaging in regular

consultation, collaborating with iwi and incorporating

their perspectives and concerns into planning and

operations.

**I.** **Introduction**


Nelson Airport Limited (“NAL”) is a Council Controlled Trading Organisation under section 6 of the Local
Government Act 2002.


This Statement of Intent is presented by the Directors of NAL in accordance with section 64 of the Local
Government Act 2002.


This Statement of Intent is for the 2023/24 Financial Year to 30 June 2024, and for the two following
financial years.


The purpose of this document is to publicly state the objectives, strategies, and targets of NAL at this
time.


NAL acknowledges the Statement of Expectation from Infrastructure Holdings Ltd dated 23rd January
2023. NAL notes the feedback from the Joint Shareholders’ Committee on the Draft Statement of Intent
of Infrastructure Holdings Ltd regarding revenue growth and climate disclosure reporting.


**II. Strategic Context**


**A. Purpose**


_**Our Vision**_


  To be a world class airport where zero emissions aircraft operate


_**Our Purpose**_


  - To contribute to a sustainable and prosperous Nelson Tasman


_**Mission Statement**_

commercial facilities.


  Nelson Airport supports excellent experiences that add to visitor satisfaction.


_**Values Statement**_


Everything we do supports a culture of inclusiveness, diversity and openness and we live by our values
below:


  - **Safety** _“the condition of being protected from or unlikely to cause danger, risk, or injury”._


Safety is our top priority, informing every decision we make and the daily activities we perform.


  - **Integrity** _**“**_ _the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles”._


Statement of Intent 2023/2024

Page 3

NDOCS-1511110536-748


We are honest, open, ethical, and fair in all of our actions, respecting our customers and
colleagues alike, even when no one is watching.


  - **Teamwork** _“the combined action of a group, especially when effective and efficient”_


We work together, using our collective skills and expertise to meet the needs of our customers
and to help Nelson Airport succeed.


  - **Continuous Improvement** _“a thing that makes something better or is better than something else”._


We constantly challenge ourselves to explore opportunities to improve the quality and efficiency
of the business.


**Openness** _“willing to consider new ideas; unprejudiced”._


We’re open to new ideas and opinions, encourage curiosity, and embrace change and
innovation.


  - _**“**_
**Accountability** _the condition of being responsible for your actions”._


We hold ourselves accountable for the outcomes of our actions, good and bad.


**B. Nature and Scope of Activities**


NAL was incorporated in 1996 and purchased the assets and undertakings of the Nelson Regional
Airport Authority in March 1999.


The airport is a key strategic asset and contributor to the prosperity and growth of the Nelson Tasman
economy. Its commercial operations and services deliver significant benefits to the Nelson Tasman
region. Its primary service is moving people into and out from the region safely and efficiently. Prior to
Covid, the number of passengers through the airport was more than one million annually, however,
because of lockdowns that volume has reduced to 865,000 (December 2022 forecast) for the 2022/23
financial year. NAL has shown resilience through the Covid pandemic by remaining open for business
and it is anticipated that growing understanding of the virus will result in a return to previously predicted
levels of activity within a three-year timeframe.


Through Air New Zealand, Nelson Airport has direct links with the key cities of Auckland, Wellington,
and Christchurch. Other carriers including Originair, Sounds Air and Golden Bay Air provide direct
provincial links to the North Island cities of Palmerston North, as well as the Kapiti Coast and short hops
to “local” destinations Tākaka and Karamea in the north of the South Island. During the recent closure of
State Highway 6 between Nelson and Blenheim, Originair ran regular scheduled services between
Nelson and Blenheim with NAL’s support.


The airport supports a diverse range of businesses that service passengers or require access to air
services or airport land and building infrastructure.


Nelson Airport connects Nelson Tasman to the rest of New Zealand and the world. With the region’s
high dependency on air access and relative isolation from road, rail and sea connections, Nelson Airport
is critical to delivering on the region’s development and growth aspirations. In particular, the airport
contributes to the:


  growth and efficiency of business


Statement of Intent 2023/2024

Page 4

NDOCS-1511110536-748


  - attraction and retention of talent


  resilience of the region and its ability to respond to emergencies.


  efficiency and effectiveness of national health services


  opportunity to facilitate investment in sustainable green energy sources for future aircraft and road
fleet requirements.


  attraction of investment in local operations of international aeronautical players


NAL may also grant and administer sub-leases of the land, buildings or installations vested in NAL for
any purpose complementary to the ongoing safe and efficient operation of the Airport.


_**Revenue Analysis**_


The revenue streams earned reflect the scope of Airport activities. The diagram below illustrates a
summarised view of the forecast revenue split for the 2023/24 financial year.


Through the _Master Plan_ 2050 and recent _Development Plans_ NAL is looking to develop and market
new commercial opportunities to ensure diversification from its reliance on aeronautical activity.


_**Passenger Performance**_


Passengers travelling through the airport underpin NAL’s financial performance. _Aeronautical Charges_
earned by the airport to fund the facilities and services provided for aeronautical activities are directly
proportionate to passengers and aeronautical activity. Additionally, other significant income streams
have a strong positive correlation to total passenger numbers including _Ground Transport_, _Retail_ and
_Advertising_ .

The following graphs tell the story of NAL’s journey through the Covid pandemic – the imposition of the
lockdown, subsequent Covid restrictions, the recovery to date and the forecast ongoing recovery. NAL is
forecasting a return to annual pre-Covid record passenger performance, over one million passengers,
by FY26.

end)


**E. Accounting Policies**


NAL reports financially under the new Accounting Standards Framework implemented by the Financial
Accounting External Reporting Board to effect changes enacted by the new Financial Reporting Act
2013. For financial reporting purposes NAL is a “for-profit public sector entity”. By virtue of the size of
the business, and by election, NAL reports under the Reduced Disclosure Regime to Tier 2
requirements.


From the 2015/16 financial year NAL has undertaken General Purpose Financial Reporting utilising the
revaluation model based on the accounting concept of Fair Value. Significant valuation work was


Statement of Intent 2023/2024

Page 13

NDOCS-1511110536-748


undertaken towards this end and underpins the reporting of Property, Infrastructure and Leasehold
Interest at fair value.


NAL regularly reports internally on a monthly accounting cycle with actuals for the Balance Sheet and
Income Statement being presented to management and the Board monthly. Progress against budgets
and forecasts is regularly monitored internally and reported against.


The reporting entity for accounting and financial reporting purposes is Nelson Airport Limited. Nelson
Airport Limited has a balance date of 30th June.


Accounting policies are set out in detail in NAL’s Annual Report which is available from Nelson Airport
[Ltd website at: www.nelsonairport.co.nz.](http://www.nelsonairport.co.nz/)


**F. Dividend Policy**


NAL will use best endeavours to maximise the annual dividend pay-out to shareholders, whilst
remaining within prudent debt ratio limits, that provides for the ongoing successful operation, growth,
and development of the airport.


**G. Commercial Valuation**


The commercial value of the Shareholders’ investment in the Company is considered by the Directors to
be not less than the Shareholders’ funds as disclosed in the Statement of Financial Position published in
the last Annual Report.


The fair value of assets is supported by valuations of land, buildings, infrastructure, and the leasehold
interest in the aerodrome land by independent registered valuers as required.


A reassessment of the value of the Shareholders’ investment in NAL may be undertaken as required
from time to time by the Shareholders or Directors.


**H. Procedure for Acquisition of Other Interests**


If the Directors believe NAL should invest in or otherwise acquire any interest in any other organisation,
they will obtain the prior approval of the Shareholders by special resolution, unless the total cost is less
than $50,000. In this case, prior approval will not be required but Shareholders will be advised in writing
within 14 days.


**IV. Non-Financial Performance**


**A.** **Sustainability, Risk Management & Reporting**


NAL is committed to reducing its impact on the environment, including its contribution to climate change,
as well as providing transparency to the community on the potential impacts of climate change on airport
operations.


**Risk Management:**


NAL has a comprehensive risk management framework in place that is reviewed monthly by the Board.
This framework includes risks pertaining to natural hazards and climate change such as inundation,
significant weather events, and natural disasters.


Statement of Intent 2023/2024

Page 14

NDOCS-1511110536-748


**Carbon reduction:**


NAL has committed to two specific goals for carbon emissions reduction:


  An 80% reduction of gross carbon emissions from 2019FY to 2035FY, and


  Net zero carbon emissions by 2050 .


Whilst NAL is not a member of the Climate Leaders Coalition, the first point above aligns with the
Coalition’s goal of contributing to holding the increase in global warming to 1.5 degrees. NAL’s
performance against this target will be independently verified. Achieving this result for Scope 1 and 2
emissions requires NAL to transition to 100% green energy use for both terminal and tenant services.


**Climate change:**


Following the August 2022 weather event, NAL began developing a resilience plan which identified the
physical risks to the Airport from natural events such as the increase in rainfall while Jenkins Creek is at
high tide  The resilience plan currently being completed will focus on the next 30 years and will identify
mitigation strategies around stormwater networks, detention basin, pump stations, stop banks and rock
walls.


**Waste Minimisation:**


With the appointment of a Sustainability Manger in FY24, NAL will focus on reducing waste and
increasing recycling, this being pursued as part of an initiative to engage more deeply with the wider
Airport tenants and suppliers to establish environmental champions and raise the priority of
environmental management matters.


**Climate related disclosures:**


Consistent with the requirements of Council Shareholders and Infrastructure Holding Limited (IHL), NAL
will commence reporting against the Climate-related Disclosures (NZ CS 1) standard in FY2024.


The reporting will be matured through three phases: scoping, qualitative and quantitative compliance
over three years, with full compliance in FY2026. This reporting will cover the following areas:


1. Governance


2. Strategy


3. Risk Management


4. Metrics and targets.


FY24 Projects underway to both reduce our carbon footprint and build resilience against natural events
including those caused by climate change **:**


  Proactively pursue confirmation of Project 2-Zero NoR & Private Plan Change to protect ability to
host zero-emission aircraft and develop green energy generation as a Permitted Activity


  Stormwater airside replacement project


  Engagement with market players regarding commercial opportunity for hydrogen eco system and
generation in Nelson


  Roll out the composting programme with tenants


Statement of Intent 2023/2024

Page 15

NDOCS-1511110536-748


  Continue with carbon offsetting


  Introduce eBus infrastructure upgrades


  Stipulate new building requirements which must include carbon footprint reduction capability


  Achieve Level 2 Airport Carbon Accreditation


  Complete feasibility study for green energy production on airport by June 2024


**B. Health and Safety**


NAL has a CAA approved Safety Management System (SMS) in place, ensuring compliance of our
airside operations. Our SMS is also independently audited annually by an aviation consultancy.  NAL
continues to evolve the system which allows for more efficient and effective reporting of risks, hazards
and incidents and provides a better overview of the health and safety environment at any given time.
Continual improvement is a pillar of the system, and we will continue to deliver advancements in
managing safety.


We recognise that procedures and processes can only provide a certain level of assurance however and
that the main hazard at the airport is that created by people.


We continue to see open and honest communication with operators and stakeholders as the key
element in driving a successful safety culture. NAL holds regular safety and security discussions with
stakeholders to drive improvements where businesses co-exist. NAL is also an active member of the
Safety Managers Forum created by the NZ Airports Association.


**C. Relationships with Customers/Stakeholders/Iwi**


In 2023 we will continue to build on the early steps we have made towards a closer relationship with iwi
through the Iwi Chairs Forum. We have engaged a strategy and engagement specialist with strong
experience and connections in iwi engagement, using recognised consultants to facilitate a 360-degree
review of the airport’s operational and strategic opportunities to draw out those that align with iwi
aspirations and allow us to better identify the greatest opportunities for a mutually rewarding partnership.

This work will support the development of a Māori Responsiveness Plan and associated work
programme for Nelson Airport.

Alongside this, we will continue to work on building our cultural capability internally, with Te Reo Māori
classes offered to all interested staff from 2023. The first group began their classes with Te Ataarangi in
March 2023.
