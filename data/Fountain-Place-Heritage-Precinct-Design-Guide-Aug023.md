## **introduction**

#### **DI1 Why a Design Guide?**

The Council, in the development of the Nelson Resource Management Plan (the
Plan), has identified particular residential areas which it considers merit
protection as Heritage Precincts.


The Heritage Precinct recognises that the whole is greater than the sum of the
parts; that a collection of Heritage Buildings, in context, has a greater impact on
the observer and the resident, and has greater heritage value than the same
number of buildings scattered throughout the city. The loss or the
unsympathetic alteration to even a single building detracts from the whole
Precinct rather like a missing tooth from a smile.


An important role of the Guidelines will be educational - to raise the awareness
of the residents and possible developers of the special nature of this Precinct, and
the impact on the street of alterations undertaken on a single building.


The Guide shall ensure that alterations to existing buildings, and new buildings
in the Precinct, are sensitive and enhance the existing visual qualities of the

streetscape.

#### **DI2 General Objectives of the Design Guidelines**


a) To identify the essential heritage values of each Precinct.
b) To set out ways in which these values can be protected and enhanced.
c) To provide education and information for building owners contemplating
changes to their property.
d) To help develop city-wide recognition of the value of these areas to the
Nelson community.

#### **DI3 How the Design Guidelines Operate**


The Design Guidelines operate on three levels:


i) They give a simple description of the history, the visual characteristics and
the special nature of the Precinct, thereby promoting residents’ and the
public’s awareness of, and sensitivity to, our heritage contained within the

Precinct.


ii) Owners and designers will find them a useful reference for preparing
sympathetic designs for new buildings or building alterations.


iii)  In reviewing development proposals the Nelson City Council will use the


Design Guidelines as a measure of how well the intended design fits the

objectives and policies of the Nelson Resource Management Plan.


Buildings within the Precinct will need to meet the requirements of the Plan.


**Fountain Place** **Nelson City Council** **3**
**Design Guide** **August 2023**


Note in particular the rules in Chapter 7 relating to Heritage Precincts and the
demolition or removal of houses.


The Design Guidelines deal with three different situations:


a) new buildings, including houses;
b) alterations and additions to non-listed buildings; and
c) alterations and additions to listed Heritage Buildings (ie. heritage buildings
listed in the Plan, Appendix 1).


The Guidelines are concerned primarily with the streetscape and the appearance
of the buildings from the street.


The street elevation is obviously part of the streetscape, however the significance
of the side walls and roof to the streetscape depend on such issues as the distance
between houses and the height of a house in relation to its neighbours. This will
be assessed by Council staff on an individual basis. Interior alterations or
additions at the rear, or private areas of dwellings, which cannot be seen from
the street are not covered by the Guidelines.

#### **DI4 Area covered by the Design Guidelines**


A map showing the extent of the Precinct is attached at the end of the
Performance Guidelines, along with a table which identifies the listed Heritage
Buildings.


The Precinct includes non-listed buildings where these form an integral part of
the visual catchment. The aim, over time, is to achieve more sympathetic
development on non-listed sites as these are altered or rebuilt.

## **guidelines -** **fountain place** **precinct**

#### **FP1 Historical Context**

The Street was formerly Beachville Street, but was changed to Fountain Place.
The area contains an interesting collection of old villas, cottages and bungalows,
interspersed with new houses.


Several of the cottages were built in the 1860s and 1870s. Six of the houses are
listed Heritage Buildings.


The valley, within which the street is located, gives it a strong feeling of “place”
and sense of identity. Fountain Square, the grassed area at the top of the street,
provides a communal outdoor area and is an important feature.

#### **FP2 Objectives**


The key design objectives within the Fountain Place Precinct are:


a) to maintain the listed Heritage Buildings and encourage the restoration of
the street frontages;
b) to ensure alterations and additions maintain the architectural integrity of
listed Heritage Buildings and enhance the appearance of non-listed
buildings in line with the general streetscape; and
c) to ensure that the design of new houses is sympathetic to the neighbouring
houses and the streetscape so that the visual qualities of the Precinct are
enhanced.

#### **FP3 Visual Characteristics**


FP3.1 Height


The houses are a mixture of single and two storey. Because of the more open
nature of the street and the ridges around three sides, the two storey houses fit
in well with the single storey.


FP3.2 Setback from the Street and Density


There is no consistency in the positioning of the houses, depending more on the
shape and location of the section. The sections are quite large allowing space for
trees and gardens. This open spacious character should be maintained.


FP3.3 Verandahs


The old villas have wonderful verandahs facing onto the streets. These are an


**Fountain Place** **Nelson City Council** **5**
**Design Guide** **August 2023**


important feature of the villa design and provide the transition space between
the public street and private home. Residents are encouraged to maintain the
verandahs and the detailing.


FP3.4 Garaging


Off street parking is often difficult to achieve in this street and the location of
the garage is determined by site constraints. Garaging should be done sensitively
to ensure that it does not dominate the house or streetscape and should, in
general style, complement the streetscape.


FP3.5 Fencing


The intimacy of the street depends upon the openness of the houses to the street.
The original low fences are ideal for this purpose, gently defining the boundary,
but maintaining openness. High fences are inappropriate. Materials should be
sympathetic to the houses.


FP3.6 Materialsand Detailing


Timber weatherboards and corrugated iron roofing are the original materials and
are an integral part of the character of the houses.


Strong emphasis must be placed on the use of materials and detailing that is
sympathetic to the original design.


FP3.7 Windowsand Doors


The window and door design, shape and proportion are
important elements in the design of the houses with the
frames and surrounds creating depth to the facade, detail,
and a shadow line around the openings. Inappropriate
replacement windows can destroy the facade.


New houses should maintain similar proportions, and level
of detail and depth with their windows, to link them with
the existing housing.

#### **FP4 Performance Guidelines**


FP4.1 Listed Heritage Buildings


The listed Heritage Buildings are important elements in the Precinct. They shall
be retained and their values preserved, and:


a) demolition or removal of group A and B Heritage Buildings requires a
resource consent under the Nelson Resource Management Plan;
b) additions or alterations which impact on the streetscape shall continue the
use of timber weatherboards, corrugated roofing, timber joinery and
detailing all to match the original. Windows should match the original in
shape, size and proportion; and
c) existing verandahs shall be maintained. Building-in of existing verandahs

shall be avoided.

FP4.2 Non-listed Buildings


Demolition or removal of non-listed houses in the Heritage Precinct requires a
resource consent under the Nelson Resource Management Plan.


Alterations and additions which impact on the streetscape shall enhance the
building and be in keeping with the Precinct and:


a) aluminium window joinery may be used for windows viewed from the
street but the proportions must be in keeping with the Precinct, using
details to create similar pane sizes, depth and level of detail;
b) materials may differ from the listed Heritage Buildings, however the
designer shall select materials that complement and enhance the values of
the Precinct; and
c) roof shapes and roof pitch should relate to the existing houses; and
d) the addition of verandahs is encouraged.


FP4.3 New Buildings


a) shall be designed in such a way as to enhance, complement and be
sympathetic to the existing streetscape;
b) the form and scale of the new work shall be in keeping with the existing
houses;
c) aluminium window joinery may be used on windows which are viewed
from the street but the proportions must be in keeping with the Precinct,
using details to create similar proportion, depth and level of detail;
d) materials used on new work may differ from the listed Heritage Buildings,
however the designer shall select materials that complement and enhance
the values of the Precinct;
e) the addition of verandahs is encouraged; and
f) roof lines shall follow the form of existing houses.


FP4.4 Garages


Garages are permitted in the front yard, only when it is not reasonably practical
to provide a garage at the rear or side. Garages shall be designed to be
complementary to the streetscape in form, detail and use of materials.


FP4.5 Fences


New fences on the street frontages shall be a maximum 900 mm in height above
ground level, constructed with vertical timber pickets or wrought iron.


FP4.6 Fountain Square


This area shall be kept open and grassed for communal use.

## **planning** **applications**

#### **PA1 Application of the Nelson Resource Management** **Plan**

The following activities are permitted (no resource consent is required):


Interior alterations to any building within the Heritage Precinct (unless
otherwise specified in Appendix 1 Heritage Buildings, Places and Objects).


Exterior alterations to any part of a building visible from a street or public space
within the Heritage Precinct, if:


a) the work is redecoration, restoration or insignificant alteration of any
existing fabric or detailing; and


b) it is carried out to the same scale as the original, including window scale,
and with materials and details similar to, or having the same appearance
to those originally used.


The following activities require a resource consent application:


a) all new buildings; and


b) exterior alterations to any part of an existing building which is visible from
a street or public space within the Heritage Precinct, if the work is not a
permitted activity according to the definition above.


The consent application will be a Restricted Discretionary Activity. Such
applications will be non-notified ie. considered without notification.


The Council’s assessment of the application will be based on:


i) compliance with the Design Guide for the Precinct.


ii) any effects (both positive and adverse) on the heritage values of the entire
Heritage Precinct.


iii) any cumulative or precedent effects on the values of the Precinct.


Note that a resource consent application is also required for the removal of an
unreinforced masonry chimney, a customer connection from a network utility,
or a sustainability addition, where permitted standards are not met (refer to the
Heritage Precinct rules in Chapter 7 of the Plan). A resource consent application
is also required for any proposal to demolish or remove a house within the
Precinct (see PA3 below).

#### **PA2 Consultation**


Early consultation with the Nelson City Council Planning Department is
encouraged to resolve design issues prior to lodging a resource consent
application. Consultation should begin at the commencement of design.


**Fountain Place** **Nelson City Council** **11**
**Design Guide** **August 2023**


#### **PA3 Demolition or removal of Buildings**

The Nelson Resource Management Plan should be consulted if demolition or
removal of any house in the Precinct is contemplated, whether or not it is a listed
Heritage Building. Any application for consent to demolish or remove must
satisfy the tests in the Plan.


In addition, any demolition or removal application must be accompanied by a
resource consent application for the intended replacement building.

#### **PA4 Supporting information required**


Resource consent applications for any building development shall include:


a) the street elevation of the building, extended to show the elevations of the
buildings on either side.
b) a written analysis of the manner in which the proposed development
responds to the Design Guide and how it relates to the heritage values of
the Precinct.
