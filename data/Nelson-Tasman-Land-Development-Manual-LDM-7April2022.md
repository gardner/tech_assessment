### NELSON TASMAN LAND DEVELOPMENT MANUAL


September 2020
Revision 1


Page 2 of 409


**Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual**


**Foreword**


This is the first joint Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual (NTLDM). It replaces the Tasman
District Council Engineering Standards 2013 and the Nelson Land Development Manual 2010, and
provides one set of standards for the Nelson and Tasman regions.


The NTLDM is a document that combines network asset design and construction requirements for
both Nelson and Tasman regions. It also includes formation and construction standards for some
private assets that connect to network assets.


The NTLDM is intended to provide consistent minimum standards and guidance for network assets
that Council will accept as part of its network, and activities affecting them including maintenance
and operations. The aim is to achieve the right balance between durable, cost effective,
environmentally sustainable and fit-for-purpose infrastructure for our communities.


The Manual has been developed in consultation with a range of stakeholders including key staff
from both councils, a steering group including Councillors and external advisers, and with input
from surveyors, developers, consultants, network utility owners, walking/cycling groups, industry
training organisations, suppliers and contractors.


This manual includes some significant changes or additions to the previous Nelson Land
Development Manual and Tasman’s Engineering Standards. In particular, changes have been
made to the way roads are designed and how we manage stormwater.


Nelson City Council and Tasman District Council encourage innovative and sustainable design and
welcome alternative solutions to this Manual where this will achieve better results.


The NTLDM will be regularly reviewed and amended to reflect changes in land development
practice and feedback from stakeholders. Revision one has now been updated with feedback from
stakeholders.


Council has also developed a series of Practice Notes associated with the NTLDM. They provide
guidance on achieving best practice, and include:


  - Stormwater Inundation Practice Note – providing best practice for calculating minimum
ground and/or floor levels for subdivision, new buildings and major alterations.


  - Bioretention Practice Note – developed specifically for stormwater management with an
emphasis on environmental protection and the mitigation of development-related impacts
on flooding and surface waterways, including reducing peak flows, reducing spills and
reducing water pollution.


  - Wetland Practice Note – intended to primarily support the design and delivery of
constructed wetlands for stormwater treatment for water quality improvements.


The councils consider this an important document for delivering the shared goals for affordable and
resilient asset management while balancing community expectations for our environment.

**CHAPTER 1** **INTRODUCTION**


**1** **GENERAL**


This document is the Nelson-Tasman Land Development Manual 2020 (Revision 1) (NTLDM) and contain
revisions and corrections noted within the 2019 version.

The NTLDM is a document that combines network asset design and construction requirements for both
Nelson and Tasman regions. It is intended to provide consistent minimum standards and guidance for
network assets that Council will accept as part of its network, and activities affecting them including
maintenance and operations. It also includes formation and construction standards for some private assets
that connect to network assets.

The NTLDM replaces former Engineering Standards, the Nelson Land Development Manual, and the
Tasman District Engineering Standards.

The relationship of the NTLDM to asset management functions under the Local Government Act (2002) and
resource management functions of Council under the Resource Management Act (1991) is important.

All development within Nelson and Tasman must be consistent with the requirements of the respective
Resource Management Plans (RMPs), being the Tasman RMP and the Nelson RMP. Development must be
consistent with applicable RMP rules, either by meeting conditions for permitted activities or by applying for
and gaining a resource consent.

However, where a new Council network asset is being created, maintained, or replaced through
development, such as a new road or water supply pipeline, it is the NTLDM that provides more detailed
design and construction standards of what the Councils will accept and take over as a public asset.
Additionally, practice notes provide comprehensive design details that can support developers and
maintenance and operation contractors in carrying out their activities in a way that will meet Council’s
expectations for design and construction. Altogether, these can also aid the Councils in achieving levels of
service that are set out in Long Term Plans and objectives of the RMP’s.

Parts of the NTLDM are externally referenced provisions of the Nelson Resource Management Plan or
Tasman Resource Management Plan, where specified in those plans. The specified parts will be subject to
First Schedule requirements of the Resource Management Act as “externally referenced” standards.


**1.1 Purpose**


The purpose of the NTLDM is to provide standards and guidance for the design, construction, maintenance,
repair and replacement of:


   - network assets and infrastructure that are or will be owned by the Councils; and

   - some private assets that connect to public assets.

The standards aim to ensure the effective and efficient provision of infrastructure and environmental
requirements.

The performance outcomes that the Councils seek to achieve are:


a) A standard of service that ensures the health, safety and wellbeing of people and communities;


b) Network assets and infrastructure that are designed to avoid or minimise risks associated with natural
hazards and climate change effects, with particular regard for lifeline networks;


c) The delivery of services to levels set out in the Long Term Plan (LTP);


d) Assets and infrastructure that meet obligations for the sustainable management of natural and
physical resources;


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 1 - Introduction and General Provisions
Page 1/4


e) The delivery of environmental outcomes that are consistent with the objectives of the RMPs;


f) The effective and efficient provision of network utilities and infrastructure, with Network Utility providers
responsible for telecommunications, electricity and transportation;


g) Network infrastructure that is affordable over the whole-of-life of the asset; and


h) Innovative water sensitive design and good urban design solutions, where network performance and
cost effectiveness goals can be met.


**1.2 Outline of Document**


The NTLDM is organised into three parts.

**Part I Introduction (Chapters 1-3)**

This sets out how the document will be used, how it relates to other functions of Council, and its legal
context. It also contains general provisions that apply to all sections of the document, including process
requirements, engineering design details required and definitions.

**Part II Standards (Chapters 4-10)**

These chapters contain all standards, both mandatory ones and those that indicate what Council considers
to be good practice. These are intended for network asset creation, maintenance, repair and replacement,
and they are organised in terms of each asset, such as “Stormwater”, “Transportation” and “Water”. As well
as the standards themselves, each chapter also sets out performance outcomes, tabulates other important
standards relevant to that asset and summarises cross references to the respective RMPs.

**Part III Appendices**

The Appendices cover additional guidance forms and checklists. Associated with this manual are Practice
Notes which contain detailed guidance about “acceptable solutions”, giving more practical guidance on the
design and construction of solutions and devices that Council will accept as part of its network.


**1.3 The Standards**


The standards themselves are set out according to relevant design or construction consideration and broken
down into two broad groupings being “mandatory” and “good practice” matters.

Mandatory matters are those which are a benchmark standard for design or construction that Council will
accept. They represent a “line in the sand” that can help to ensure that Council-defined levels of service will
met. They also provide a clear pathway for acceptance and certainty for developers and contractors.

However, both Councils recognise that in some situations the standards might not be the best way to
achieve the performance outcomes sought, due to the particularities of the site or situation. Council also
accepts that some design outcomes cannot easily be achieved by the application of a minimum standard.
For these reasons “good practice” matters are also provided.

These are intended to provide a blend of additional guidance and direction such as; indicators of preferred
methods, design formulae, matters for the exercise of discretion and general information. Where good
practice matters are applied in design or construction, it is the performance outcomes sought that will
ultimately determine what will be acceptable to Council.

Where there is a divergence from mandatory requirements, additional information and engineering design
detail may be required by Council at the time of engineering plan approval or application for resource
consent. Council will exercise discretion around the acceptability of any non-standard design and, depending
on the relevant process, consider the design against the objectives and policies of the relevant RMP and the
applicable performance outcomes of the NTLDM.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 1 - Introduction and General Provisions
Page 2/4


In the case of the Stormwater chapter, the associated practice notes are also provided to guide the design of
specific stormwater management solutions. They are acceptable solutions for meeting mandatory
requirements of the stormwater standards.


**1.4 Statutory Requirements**


The provisions of the NTLDM must be read subject to the provisions of the respective Councils’ RMP’s and to
any applicable statues, regulations, and bylaws.

The main statutes that the NTLDM relates to are:


- Resource Management Act 1991;


- Building Act 2004;


- Local Government Act 2002;


- Land Transfer Act 1952;


- Unit Titles Act 1972;


- Property Law Act 1952;


- Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act 2013; and


- Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014


Requirements from each legislative document provide consent authorities with the powers and functions to
request, provide, and supply information pertaining to the land.

In addition, Councils’ obligations for natural hazards management, including consideration of climate change
are reflected in the NTLDM standards. Requirements for design, materials and construction standards
generally have been set to minimise risks where possible and build network resilience.

Regarding Iwi liaison and consultation, developers and contractors shall be made aware of their obligations
under the Resource Management Act 1991, the Local Government Act and the New Zealand Pouhere
Taonga Act 2014.


**1.5 Applicability**


As noted above, all development is subject to the requirements of the respective RMPs.

In respect of network assets, this document applies in the following ways:


a) All infrastructure assets that are to be vested in Council.


b) All infrastructure assets constructed under contract for Council.


c) The maintenance, repair, and replacement of existing infrastructure.


d) Any development or infrastructure assets that may connect to, or have an impact on, Council’s
infrastructure assets.


**1.6 Document Control**


The NTLDM is a controlled document and amendment or re-issue is the responsibility of the Council
Engineering Managers with approval of the Council.

Amendments or reviews may be carried out three-yearly. However, an earlier individual amendment may be
made if an important alteration to a standard or technology arises. Significant amendments will be reviewed
and approved by Council.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 1 - Introduction and General Provisions
Page 3/4


Amendments to some of the mandatory matters of the NTLDM may also be subject to a public notification,
submissions and hearings process, in accordance with the First Schedule of the Resource Management Act

An electronic copy of the NTLDM is available via the Councils’ websites.

**REQUIREMENTS**


**INTRODUCTION**


**2** **PURPOSE**


The purpose of this section is to outline the requirements of designers and construction contractors
involved in the design and construction of infrastructure assets and to provide an overview of the approval
and authorisation process of the Information and data requirements, relating to the design and construction
of new infrastructure and assets.


**Requirements for Professional Qualifications and Experience**


This section sets out the minimum qualifications of those involved in the design and construction of
infrastructure and assets.


**2.1.1** **Qualifications and Experience**


2.1.1.1 The Council requires all design, construction and construction supervision of infrastructural
assets and subdivision works to be performed by suitably qualified and experienced individuals.


2.1.1.2 Contractors must hold a minimum relevant qualification and training for the proposed design or
works in accordance with the Training Requirements Schedule see Table 2-1.


2.1.1.3 Contractors must be suitably experienced in the field of work to be undertaken. The Council will
request a schedule of qualifications in support of this in advance of any work being undertaken. A
Health and Safety training qualification will be a mandatory requirement for all contractors
working on existing or future Council infrastructure.


**Infrastructure Development Process**


This section sets out the expectations for the process of design and plan preparation and an overview of
the approval process. Appendix A shows an overview of the design drawing and as-built drawing approval

process.


**Mandatory Matters**


**2.2.1** **General**


2.2.1.1 The Council standards, as set out in this document, are intended to reflect the minimum standard
required by the Council and should not be seen as a replacement for professional engineering
design.


2.2.1.2 The responsibility for site-specific design relies solely on the Designer of the work and this may
include investigation of unusual site conditions and exceptional circumstances. The Designer will
consider all risks to lifeline systems (significant infrastructure) in the event of a major natural
hazard, including but not limited to earthquake, flood, tsunami, slope failure, erosion or
inundation, including the effects of climate change.

**2.2.2** **Preliminary Discussion and Design**


The Council encourages Designers and the Developers Principal Advisor (DPA) to meet with the Council in
the early stages of design to discuss any proposed works and how these will meet the Council’s standards
and integrate with existing services and infrastructure. Information on how to obtain pre-application advice is
available on the Councils’ websites or by contacting the Council.


Prior to approval to commence work, the Council requires the submission of fully detailed Design Drawings
covering the design of all new roads, rights-of-way, access lots and service utilities. These drawings and
associated information will be reviewed by the Council and assessed against the requirements in this
document.


**2.2.3** **Review and Acceptance of Design Drawings and Supporting Information**


2.2.3.1 Design Drawings and supporting information must be submitted to and approved by the Council
prior to the commencement of physical works, and prior to the pre-construction meeting.


2.2.3.2 For large subdivisions, full Design Drawings may be required by the Council prior to subdivision
consent being granted.


2.2.3.3 The requirements of the Design Drawings and supporting information are described in
Sections 2.2.15 and 2.4.

stage, the Design Drawings will cover the whole scheme in the first instance.


2.2.4.2 In the case of major staged subdivisions where the Council’s infrastructure is involved, the Council,
at its sole discretion, may relax this requirement to the extent that preliminary service layout
drawings for the total project may be submitted for initial approval.


2.2.4.3 Fully detailed Design Drawings required for each particular stage will subsequently be submitted
for final approval.


2.2.4.4 Design Drawings for each stage will comply with the applicable Land Development Manual at the
time of the subdivision consent approval; however, should an extension of time for the consent be
granted, compliance with the current Land Development Manual at the time of extension may be
required.

**CHAPTER 4** **TRANSPORTATION**


**INTRODUCTION**


**4** **PURPOSE**


The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that the region’s transportation infrastructure is designed and
constructed to meet high standards of urban design, ensuring a safe, efficient and high amenity
environment for all users of the transport system.


This transportation chapter is divided into three sections to enable readers to quickly find the most
relevant information for their needs:


a) **Transport Network** - Transport Network illustrates the multitude of functions roads provide for
a diverse range of users. It identifies principles for designing a transport network to
accommodate the different functions and how to provide for the convenient, safe and efficient
movement of various user groups.


b) **Detailed Design** - Design identifies design principles and specifies parameters for the
transport system to achieve the objectives sought from both individual roads and the wider
transport network for all user groups. It recognises the importance and value of the transport
asset as a public place and environments in which a range of infrastructural services are
located.


c) **Construction** - Construction specifies engineering standards that apply for the construction of
particular aspects of transport infrastructure. Appropriate construction standards are essential
to ensure that Council’s assets are constructed to an appropriate quality. These standards
allow for cost-effective and long-term benefits that consider environmental effects and optimise
efficiency of Council’s ongoing operation and maintenance investment.


**4.1 Performance Outcomes**


Transportation performance outcomes sought by these standards are far wider than simply providing
for the transport service and infrastructure but extend to much broader community outcomes as shown
in Figure 4-1 below and the following list in section 4.1.1.


**Figure 4-1 Performance Outcomes**


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 - Transportation Page 1/78


**4.1.1** **Performance Outcomes - Detail**


a) A transportation network that is well connected, convenient and easy to navigate, linking
residential housing, commercial and industrial activities, points of attraction, facilities and
amenities in an efficient way;


b) A transportation network that is safe for all users;


c) A transportation network that supports a range of transportation alternatives to the private
motor vehicle, including cycling, walking, mobility scooters and public transport;


d) Transport corridors that can accommodate a range of functions, including parking, stormwater
management, utilities and public spaces;


e) Transport corridors that provide an attractive, high amenity network that recognises people’s
appreciation of its pleasantness, aesthetic coherence, and cultural and recreational attributes;


f) A transportation network that has the capacity to accommodate current and future demand
from all users of it;


g) Networks that are cost-effective over the whole of life of the transportation network;


h) A transportation network that is resilient;


i) A transportation system that encourages and enables a shift to renewable energy sources;


j) A transport system that does not contribute to flood hazard and manages the effects of water
contamination and habitat loss from stormwater discharges;


k) A transport system that enables positive well-being outcomes by providing active transport
choices, reducing transport emissions, and providing space for people to meet and interact.


**4.1.2** **Creating Good Infrastructure – Design-Led Approach**


The aim of this chapter is to enable good urban structure to be developed. It encourages a design-led
approach rather than specification of minimum standards. This is to encourage quality thinking,
collaboration and innovation to reach optimum solutions that align with the performance outcomes
listed in Section 4.1 above.

A design-led approach to transportation begins with the foundation of well-designed urban structure,
by acquiring a good understanding of the urban design principles which underlie the layout of blocks,
streets and open spaces in new developments and the inter-relationship between them.

While the focus is on new public spaces, designers are also encouraged to consider the threedimensional character of the spaces that are formed by buildings on private areas within the blocks.
The relationship between public and private areas is an essential part of creating places for people.

Access to, and within, areas to be developed includes more than the road network that provides
formal access to properties. It includes public transport routes and green linkages, such as reserves
and greenways that provide access for pedestrians and cyclists

The road network and associated linkages need to be highly connected, to reflect the desire lines and
destinations within the area and also in surrounding neighbourhoods. This encourages people to walk
or cycle where practicable, rather than using their car, particularly for shorter local trips. When this can
be achieved, it results in energy savings and creates a safer and more pleasant neighbourhood.

**4.2 Referenced Documents**


**4.2.1** **Resource Management Plan Requirements**


The standards set out in this chapter address matters that are specific to Council asset creation or
activities that may have an impact on an asset. These activities are also subject to the respective
Nelson City and Tasman District RMPs. Key sections of the Plans that relate to transportation design
and construction in this document are subdivision, land use and transportation infrastructure
provisions. This means that both the provisions in the Resource Management Plans and this Land
Development Manual do apply.


**4.2.2** **Document and Standards**


This document governs a design led approach to transportation. However, additional advice and
guidance can be found in Table 4-1. Where an Act or National Standards document is referenced, this
must be the current version including any associated amendments.

**STANDARDS**


**4.3 Design Process**


**Mandatory Matters**


**4.3.1** **General**


The network design must be led by or include:


4.3.1.1 Performance outcomes of 4.1.


4.3.1.2 Except as provided for by f) the recommendations of a Transportation Assessment Report
(TAR) by a suitably qualified and experienced transportation engineer that shows that the
proposed design can meet the transport performance outcomes set out in Section 4.1. The
TAR focus is on the following information:


4.3.1.3 Information that is gathered by the design team, and made available to Council as part of the
transport network design process, to address the following features where applicable:


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 - Transportation Page 5/78


4.3.1.4 A road safety audit report by a team of at least two suitably qualified and experienced road
safety engineers. The safety audit stage will depend on the complexity of the proposed or
existing transport network, the form of its intersections and the level of active transport
activity and the size of the development as shown in Table 4-2 below.

**4.4 Network Layout Form and Function Design**


This section sets out design standards for the layout, form and function of the transportation network.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met in the design of the layout, form and function of the
Road network:


**4.4.1** **Road Hierarchy**


4.4.1.1 Each road within the proposed design must be defined in terms of its form and function
according to the road hierarchy, as set out in this section.


4.4.1.2 All roads with a hierarchical classification of State Highway, Arterial, Principal and Collector
are grouped and termed ‘Classified Roads’.


4.4.1.3 Sub-Collector Roads, Local Roads, Residential Lanes, and Private Ways serving more than
four actual or potential lots are ‘Unclassified Roads’.


4.4.1.4 Shopping Streets will not be categorised Classified or Unclassified and will be subject to
specific design.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 - Transportation Page 7/78


**Table 4-3** **Road Hierarchy**








|Hierarchy|Description|ONRC1|
|---|---|---|
|**State**<br>**Highways**|State Highways are primary roads in the strategic road network<br>linking Nelson and Tasman to other areas of the country.<br>Safe and efficient mobility along the corridor will be the principal<br>function of State Highways, with access to adjacent land being a<br>subordinate function. State Highways will be constructed and<br>managed by the New Zealand Transport Agency.|Regional,<br>Arterial, Primary<br>Collector or<br>Secondary<br>Collector|
|**Arterial**<br>**Roads**|Arterial roads will be designed to join centres of population within<br>regions and neighbouring regions and provide links to the higher<br>order State Highway network. Safe and efficient mobility along the<br>corridor is the principal function of Arterials with access to adjacent<br>land being a subordinate function. Arterial roads are constructed and<br>managed to minimise their local access function.|Regional or<br>Arterial|
|**Principal**<br>**Roads**|Principal roads will connect and augment the higher order transport<br>system. These roads link adjacent suburbs, smaller centres and<br>areas of population and facilitate movement to and access of major<br>attractors and industrial areas.<br>Principal roads will have multiple functions of moving people and<br>goods safety and efficiently whilst also providing access to major<br>employment areas and attractors and movement across corridors.<br>The function of mobility long Principal roads will not dominate the<br>management of the corridor to the detriment of access to adjacent<br>land use.<br>The effects of traffic generated by adjacent land use will not detract<br>from the mobility function of the corridor of a Principal road.<br>Principal Roads will accommodate short to medium length trips<br>associated with through traffic and local traffic.<br>Public transport, walking and cycling will be accommodated within<br>Principal Roads.|Primary<br>Collector|
|**Shopping**<br>**Streets**<br>**(Tasman)**<br>**and City**<br>**Streets**<br>**(Nelson)**|Shopping Streets have a range of functions, which means a ‘design<br>led’ approach is required for them.<br>Therefore, they are not categorised, i.e. neither Classified nor<br>Unclassified. Typically, these roads provide high levels of pedestrian<br>priority, on-road parking supply, amenity, and local traffic<br>circulation/servicing.|NA|



1 One Road Network Classification (ONRC) is shown in

Table 4-3 for information only. The ONRC classification of Council’s roads is its current function
classification used primarily for funding and activity management purposes only.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 8/78


|Hierarchy|Description|ONRC1|
|---|---|---|
|**Collector**<br>**Roads**|Collector roads will be designed to distribute traffic between and<br>within local areas and form a link between higher order (Principal and<br>Arterial) roads and lower order (Sub-Collector and Local) roads.<br>Collector Roads will be designed to accommodate local traffic and<br>provide access to adjoining property. In the urban area, Collector<br>roads must have a predominantly residential frontage and where<br>required, contain the bus routes within the neighbourhood.|Primary or<br>Secondary<br>Collector|
|**Sub**<br>**Collector**<br>**Roads**|Sub-Collector roads will be designed to distribute the vehicular traffic<br>at a neighbourhood level and form the link between Collector roads<br>and Local roads. A high proportion of traffic on these roads has an<br>origin or destination within the immediate area.<br>In residential areas, Sub-Collector roads must provide high levels of<br>amenity and prioritise access to adjoining property over local traffic<br>movements. Through traffic is not a desired outcome for Sub-<br>Collector roads.|Secondary<br>Collector or<br>Access|
|**Local Roads**|Local roads will be designed for the primary function of providing<br>direct access to properties fronting the access road and along which<br>only traffic having an origin or destination will travel. Pedestrian and<br>local amenity values predominant.<br>Local roads must also be designed to ensure a safe and high amenity<br>environment for pedestrians and cyclists, so that the road is a shared<br>multi-functional public space|Access or Low<br>Volume|
|**Residential**<br>**Lanes**|Residential Lanes are public roads that will be designed to provide<br>access for between seven and 20 residential units.<br>Residential lanes will be designed to have the visual appearance of a<br>Private Access Way, to discourage use by non-local vehicular traffic.<br>Vehicular and pedestrian access to frontage properties is the key<br>function.|Low Volume|
|**Service**<br>**Lanes**|Service Lanes will be designed for the purpose of providing side or<br>rear access for vehicular traffic to land in industrial or commercial<br>areas.

**4.4.2** **Design within the Hierarchy**


When determining road form and function within the hierarchy, the following matters must be
addressed in the design and discussed in the TAR:


4.4.2.1 Connectivity, to ensure the efficient and logical movement of people from place to place;


4.4.2.2 Amenity of the street and/or neighbourhood;


4.4.2.3 Design that encourages appropriate traffic speeds and operating conditions across the
various elements of the transport network;


4.4.2.4 A layout that enables easy organisation and management of the transport network;


4.4.2.5 A layout that prioritised safety of the transport network; and


4.4.2.6 Choice of road that seeks opportunities to address land use and/or transport deficiencies
from a number of land use or transport investment perspectives.


4.4.2.7 The inter-relationship of the road hierarchy is illustrated schematically in Figure 4-2.













**Figure 4-2 Inter-relationship of Road Hierarchy**


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 10/78


**4.4.3** **Minimum Intersection Spacing**


Minimum intersection spacing will be:


4.4.3.1 The minimum centreline to centreline separation of any two roads with regulatory speeds of
50km/h or below intersecting an urban ‘Classified Road’ will be 110m, increased to 150m
where the intersecting roads meet the ‘Classified Road’ in a left-right stagger;


4.4.3.2 Intersections of urban ‘Unclassified Roads’ with regulatory speeds of 50km/h or below will
provide a minimum centreline to centreline separation of 40m; and


4.4.3.3 The intersection spacing rules for speeds of 50km/h or below is schematically illustrated in
Figure 4-3.


4.4.3.4 For roads with regulatory speeds above 50km/h the minimum intersection will be as show in
Table 4-4.


**Table 4-4** **Intersection Spacing above 50Km/h**

|RegulatorySpeed(km/h)|MinimumIntersectionSpacing(m)|
|---|---|
|100|800|
|80|550|
|70|220|
|60|160|

**Figure 4-3 Minimum Intersection Separation in areas with a regulatory speed of 50km/h or**

**below**


**4.4.4** **Connectivity**


4.4.4.1 Where future development on adjoining land is possible, land within the development will be
set aside to ensure that future connection is not precluded. The spacing of road connections
to adjacent future areas should consider the potential future network requirements of the
wider area.


4.4.4.2 Cul-de-sacs that may function as future through roads must be designed to the standard of
the future function.


4.4.4.3 Isolation strips will not be permitted when properties are developed.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 12/78


4.4.4.4 The number and length of cul-de-sacs will be minimised, to encourage connectivity and
navigability. The roading layout presented in Figure 4-4 shows a layout where the entire road
network off the main road would be classified as a long cul-de-sac and is not permitted. The
roading layout presented in Figure 4-5 shows how a connected road network can reduce the
prevalence of cul-de-sacs.


**Figure 4-4 Extent of Cul-de-sac – Not Permitted**


**Figure 4-5 Extent of Cul-de-sacs - Permitted**


4.4.4.5 A cul-de-sac in residential zones will be no longer than 150m and serve no more than 25
potential residential dwellings, except in ‘Hillside Environments’ where subject to the
Engineering Manager’s approval a cul-de-sac may have a length of up to 400m while serving
no more than 40 potential residential dwellings.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 - Transportation Page 13/78


4.4.4.6 No more than 15 per cent of lots in any residential zone development, except in ‘Hillside
Environments’, will have frontage to a cul-de-sac.


4.4.4.7 A cul-de-sac in Commercial or Industrial zones will be no longer than 120m.


4.4.4.8 Cul-de-sacs must be designed so that pedestrians and cyclists have through access,
especially where that access would link to local facilities, other roads or recreation
opportunities, as illustrated in Figure 4-6.


**Figure 4-6 Cul-de-sac public accessway connection for active transport**


**4.4.5** **Pedestrian, Cyclist and Public Transportation**


4.4.5.1 The transport network must facilitate walking, cycling and use of public transport for access
to daily activities.


**4.4.6** **Structures**


4.4.6.1 The use of retaining walls, bridges and culverts will be subject to Engineering Manager
approval.


**4.4.7** **Commercial Zone Design**


4.4.7.1 The design of the commercial road layout will include a high amenity berm area for the
inclusion of street furniture complementary to the commercial space such as cycle racks,
litter bins, amenity planting and seating.

**4.5 Design for the Speed Environment**


This section outlines standards and guidance for the design of roads that create a safe speed
environment, consistent with road form and function.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met in the design of roads:


**4.5.1** **Design for Target Speed**


4.5.1.1 The road designer will determine the target speed for each road as set out in Table 4-5.


**Table 4-5** **Target Speed Environment**















|RoadHierarchy|Classified/Unclassified|TargetSpeedEnvironment|
|---|---|---|
|Arterial Roads|Classified|Speed Limit|
|Principal Roads|Principal Roads|Speed Limit|
|Collector Roads|Collector Roads|Speed Limit|
|Sub-Collector Roads|Unclassified|10km/h less than speed limit*|
|Local Roads|Local Roads|20km/h less than speed limit *|
|Residential Lanes, Service Lanes|Residential Lanes, Service Lanes|20km/h|
|Private Ways|NA|20km/h|



 - Assuming a speed limit of 50km/h. The target speed environment should not be below 30km/h.


In Rural Lifestyle zones the target speed environment will be a maximum of 60km/h.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 - Transportation Page 17/78


4.5.1.2 The designer will address each of the following matters in the design of the road, to show
how they have been considered in the design of the speed environment to meet the
requirements of Table 4-5.


4.5.1.3 The width of the road and how it has been designed to encourage speed reduction;


4.5.1.4 Road alignment and visibility, and how these elements have been treated to encourage low
speeds;


4.5.1.5 Road vertical elements, and their effect on the perception of the need to travel cautiously;


4.5.1.6 Vegetation, and the effect on visibility to reduce speed without creating traffic safety hazard;


4.5.1.7 Parking, and the likely demand for road-side parking as it can affect road speed behaviours;


4.5.1.8 Land use activities on adjoining land, especially high traffic generating ones such as schools,
community amenities and commercial activities;


4.5.1.9 A suitably qualified and experienced traffic engineer will include within the transportation
assessment report (TAR) how the proposed design will meet the target speed environment
including evidence of the ability of any proposed road design to reduce speeds to the target
speed.


**4.5.2** **Traffic Calming Devices**


4.5.2.1 The selection of traffic calming devices must be compatible with the intended road function.


4.5.2.2 The selection and placement of traffic calming devices will be consistent with Austroads
Guide to Traffic Management: Part 8 – Local Area Traffic Management. Any device will
require Council’s approval.


4.5.2.3 Speed humps and other vertical speed control devices cannot be used on Sub Collector,
Collectors, Principal or Arterial roads nor state Highways.

**4.6 Transport Cross-Sections**


This section outlines Council’s expectations for road widths and features to be included in the crosssection design of transport corridors.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met in the design of transport cross-sections:


**4.6.1** **General**


4.6.1.1 The number and minimum widths (specified in metres) of key road elements, categorised by
hierarchy, are shown in Table 4-6 for Collector, Principal and Arterial Roads (Classified) and
in Table 4-7 for Sub-Collector Roads, Local Roads, Residential Lanes and Service Lanes
(Unclassified), see also SD411.


4.6.1.2 Where an existing road is developed along its frontage and that road does not have the
required road reserve width, road to vest will be required along that frontage and be vested
with Council without compensation.


4.6.1.3 As a condition of consent, the road frontage must be upgraded to the required design for that
category of road at the cost of the developer.


4.6.1.4 Stormwater quality treatment design is required on most classified roads, refer section 5.3.8
for details.

1 Where a road or access serves land in more than one zone the requirements for footpaths and berms on each side of the road or access will be the maximum required for any of the adjoining zones.

2 Where a road fronts a reserve that has a footpath aligned parallel to, and in close proximity of the road reserve boundary, then a footpath is not required to be provided within the road reserve on that side of the road. Where a road is situated close to a school, aged


care facility, church, sports field or other high pedestrian generating community facility, the footpaths to be widened to 2.0m minimum.

3 The ‘Service Strip’ may be reduced to 0.5m where there is sufficient space to locate services under the footpath without precluding the introduction of street trees.

4 The final legal road reserve width may vary from the legal road reserve width shown in Table 4-6. The indicative legal road widths assume that all elements are provided to the minimum width and located alongside one another with no cut or fill batters.

5 A narrower Road Reserve width will be acceptable to Council if the ‘Berm’ and cycle facility separating strip are able to be combined into a single 1.5m landscaped strip except in the Commercial zone.

6 If there is existing parking demand then provide 2.0m width in residential zones and 2.3m width in industrial zones.

7. Cycle separating strips and the berm area should be combined, subject to specific design that considers operating speed, appropriate separation, heavy vehicle, vehicle and cycle volumes.

8 Zoning refers to the generic zone reference in zone terminology of Chapter 3 – Definitions.

9 The cycle facility in rural zones may be omitted if there is no current or future demand at the sole discretion of the Engineering Manager.

1 Where a road or access serves land in more than one zone the requirements for footpaths and berms on each side of the road or access will be the maximum required for any of the adjoining zones.

2 In ‘Hillside Environments’ on unclassified roads in Nelson the berm and footpath may be excluded from the uphill side of the road. In Tasman “Hillside Environments” all roads, berms and footpaths require careful specific design to the satisfaction of the Engineering


Manager.

3 Where a road fronts a reserve that has a footpath aligned parallel to, and in close proximity of the road reserve boundary, then a footpath is not required to be provided within the road reserve on that side of the road. Where a road is situated close to a school, aged

care facility, church, sports field or other high pedestrian generating community facility, the footpaths to be widened to 2.0m minimum.

4 The ‘Service Strip’ may be reduced to 0.5m where there is sufficient space to locate services under the footpath without precluding the introduction of street trees.

5 Passing bays will be provided at least every 50m or where appropriate. Mutual driveways may be used as passing bays. The minimum dimensions for a passing bay are a width of 5.5m (including carriageway) and minimum length of 6.0m with a 4.0m long taper at


each end).

6 The requirement is 5.5m for the first 12m from any intersection with higher order roads (Local Roads and above). Thereafter, the traffic lane width may be narrowed to 3.5m. Mutual driveways will be provided at adjoining lot boundaries (12.0m total width) to


function as passing bays at least every 50m. The minimum dimensions for a passing bay are a width of 5.5m (including carriageway) and minimum length of 6.0m with a 4.0m long taper at each end).


7 Refer clause 4.12.1.1


8 Cycle facilities not required provided design allows shared space with low speed environment.

9 The cycle facility in rural zones may be omitted if there is no current or future demand.at the sole discretion of the Engineering Manager

10 A road will only be designed and constructed as a Residential Lane with the prior approval of the Engineering Manager when considering the factors in section 4.4.12.

11 The final legal road reserve width may vary from the legal road reserve width shown in Table 4-6. The indicative legal road widths assume that all elements are provided to the minimum width and located alongside one another with no cut or fill batters.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 22/78


**4.6.2** **Shoulder Design**


4.6.2.1 The shoulder will be widened to 2.5m on the outside of any curve less than 1000m radius on
rural classified roads in accordance with Austroads Part 3 Guide to Rural Road Design section
4.3.4, to allow erring drivers to be able to recover safety back onto the road.


**4.6.3** **Flush Medians**


4.6.3.1 Flush medians will be widened at intersections and at the access to high traffic generating
activities to accommodate turning bays.


4.6.3.2 Flush medians that accommodate a pedestrian and or cycle island must be at least 2.4m wide.
For marking details refer to the NZTA Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings (MOTSAM) Part II –
Markings.


**4.6.4** **Turning Area Design**


4.6.4.1 A turning facility will be provided at the end of all cul-de-sacs.


4.6.4.2 The minimum radius of the turning circle of a cul-de-sac will be 7m in residential zones, 11m in
commercial, 12m in industrial areas and 8.0m in rural lifestyle areas, as per SD417 ‘Cul-de-sac
Turning Circles’.


4.6.4.3 Residential Lanes that have only one intersection with higher order roads must be designed
with a turning area at the head.


4.6.4.4 The berm or shoulder just prior to the turning area will be designed to incorporate collection
areas for waste and recycling collection services as shown in SD417. This is to minimise the
health and safety risk of multiple reverse manoeuvres from the refuse vehicle lining up with bins
within the turning area. The collection area will be 1.0m [2] for each property accessed from the
turning head.


4.6.4.5 For residential cul-de-sacs and Residential Lanes in Nelson ‘Hillside Environments’ the turning
area may be a ‘Hammerhead’ or ‘Fishtail’ layout, as indicated in Figure 4-7 provided it is
sufficient to allow an 8m medium rigid truck with 10m turning radius to undertake a three-point
turn. In Tasman hammerhead or fishtail layouts may be used at the sole discretion of the
Engineering Manager.


**Figure 4-7 Hammerhead and Fishtail Turning Head Arrangements**


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 23/78


**4.6.5** **Staged Road Construction Ends**


4.6.5.1 Where a road is developed/constructed in stages a turning area will be provided at the end of
the construction on the balance land or within at least 20m of the end of the road and be

formed, so that all lot frontages can be developed fully, and have access to the legal road. The
pavement will be formed to the same standard as the road and permanently surfaced to provide
an area sufficient to allow a three-point turn by an 8m medium rigid truck with 10m turning
radius.


4.6.5.2 Staged road end turning areas must be located within the road reserve area.


4.6.5.3 Staged road end turning areas will be removed when the next stage is developed and kerb lines
and other associated road elements such as footpaths, streetlights and shoulders extended
through at the typical road width to ensure good alignment readability and to minimise the
sealed area and its associated ongoing maintenance liability.


4.6.5.4 If a lot is created with two road frontages in, then both roads shall be constructed and vested in
Council in the one stage. (This allows full development of the corner section and access off the
lesser road and connectivity for future landowners). In the unlikely event that a site/lot has
vehicle access via one road and also frontage (no vehicle access) to a different road (not a
corner site) then road upgrades will be addressed on a case by case basis.


**4.6.6** **Service Lanes**


4.6.6.1 Service lanes must:


**4.6.7** **Services**


4.6.7.1 The layout of all roads must accommodate infrastructural services and provide convenient
access for the maintenance of those services.


4.6.7.2 Services are not permitted to be located in the berm between the footpath and the kerb, as this
will preclude the planting of street trees. Where street trees are not proposed, the water pipe
may be located in this area.


4.6.7.3 The width between the kerb and property boundary must be designed to provide sufficient
clearance between services. In addition, there must be at least 600mm horizontal separation
between the power and the property boundary (refer SD412 and SD413).


4.6.7.4 Where street trees are planned, sufficient space must be allowed for them outside of the service
corridor with sufficient clearance so that services are not damaged by roots as the trees grow.


4.6.7.5 For upgrades to existing roads or the provision of new services in existing roads, services may
be located under the service strip adjacent to the property boundary or under the footpath.

**4.7 Batter Slope, Bridge and Retaining Structure Design**


Batter slopes, retaining walls and bridges are high value components of the transport system with long
lives and high ongoing maintenance costs thus getting the design right is critical.


**Mandatory Requirements**


The following matters are mandatory where slopes or bridge and retaining structures are a factor in the
design of the transport system:


**4.7.1** **Batter Slope**


4.7.1.1 All new cut faces must be retained or stabilised with grass.


4.7.1.2 In flat terrain, the bottom edge of the fill batter or the top of a cut batter will start at least 600mm
on the roadside of the property boundary. In ‘Hillside Environments’, the toe of the cut batter
may start 1m from the kerb or back of footpath, and the top of the fill batters may start 1m from
the kerb or back of footpath (see SD414).


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 26/78


4.7.1.3 No batter in either cutting or filling will be steeper than 1.0 vertical to 1.5 horizontal (67%)
without the approval of the Engineering Manager, and in certain cases, a geotechnical
assessment by a Chartered Professional Engineer (P.Eng.Geol.) will be required to establish
the safe batter slope and specific low maintenance landscaping/vegetation that is required,
other than grass, see 4.7.1.1.


4.7.1.4 In “Hillside Environments” all batters require specific design to the satisfaction of the
Engineering Manager.


4.7.1.5 Where a batter is not required to cater for foot traffic, grassed batters are permitted, to a
maximum of 1-in-4 (25%) to ensure they are mowable.


**4.7.2** **Support and Retaining Structures and Bridges**


4.7.2.1 Stabilised faces, retaining structures or bridges that support private assets or property:


4.7.2.2 Stabilised faces, retaining structures or bridges supporting the operation of the transport
network must:


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 27/78


**4.7.3** **Geotechnical Risk Areas**


4.7.3.1 In ground that may be subject to instability, including settlement as a result of severe seismic
shaking causing liquefaction of the underlying subsurface materials the design of the transport
system will be undertaken to the satisfaction of the Engineering Manager, by a Chartered
Professional Engineer practising in geotechnical engineering and experienced in transport
design. This includes but is not limited to Hillside Environments (Nelson), the Tahunanui Slope
Hazard Area or Slope Instability Risk Areas (Tasman).


4.7.3.2 Consideration will be made with regard to transport design so as to avoid or mitigate against the
possible effects arising from severe seismic ground shaking.


**4.7.4** **Sub-soil Drainage**


4.7.4.1 Sub soil drains installed to for the purpose of dewatering retaining walls embankments, cuttings
and the subgrade to supporting the construction on ongoing performance of the transport
network will be wholly located within the road reserve.


4.7.4.2 Subsoil drains should comprise a minimum 110mm diameter slotted pipe surrounded with
100mm minimum of free draining drainage metal. Drains will be excavated into firm ground and
will be linked together at a minimum grade of 1:250 and extended to connect into an approved

**4.8 Road Geometry**


This section sets out requirements for the geometric design of road gradients, crossfall, elevations and
safe stopping sight distances.


**Mandatory Requirements**


The following matters are requirements for the design of roads in terms of road geometry:


**4.8.1** **Gradients**


4.8.1.1 Gradients are measured on the inside of any curves at the edge of the traffic lane.


4.8.1.2 Kerb grades will not be less than 1-in-250 (0.4%).


4.8.1.3 Road gradients will not be steeper than those values specified in Table 4-8.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 29/78


**Table 4-8** **Maximum Road Gradients**

|RoadHierarchy<br>ArterialRoads|MaximumGradient*<br>1 -in-20 (5 .0%)|
|---|---|
|Principal Roads|1-in-15(6.7%)|
|Collector Roads|1-in-10(10.0%)|
|Sub-Collector Roads|1-in-8(12.5%)|
|Local Roads|1-in-7(14.3%)|
|Residential Lanes|1-in-6(15.8%)|



 - Gradients on bus routes will not be steeper than 1-in-15 (6.7%)


The average gradient (local roads and residential lanes) over 50m will not exceed 1-in-6
(16.7%)


**4.8.2** **Crossfall**


4.8.2.1 The default normal crossfall of 1-in-33 (3%) in both directions from the crown will be developed
on all standard sealed carriageways.


4.8.2.2 Where asphaltic concrete is used the crossfall will be no flatter than 1-in-50 (2%) unless on a
curve associated with the application of super-elevation.


4.8.2.3 Where a uniform crossfall is developed from kerb-to-kerb, this will not be flatter than
1-in-50 (2%).


4.8.2.4 All stormwater from the carriageway and footpaths on roads and private ways will be collected
by an approved stormwater system. Refer to Chapter 5 Stormwater, of the NTLDM for design
and construction guidance on stormwater matters.


**4.8.3** **Super Elevation**


4.8.3.1 Super-elevation is not required in areas with a speed limit of 60km/h or below.


4.8.3.2 On roads where the speed limit is over 60km/hr, specific design of super-elevation is required.


**4.8.4** **Horizontal curves**


4.8.4.1 Curves on all classified roads and roads with a speed limit above 50km/h will be transitional.


4.8.4.2 Circular curves are permitted on unclassified roads with regulatory speed limits of 50km/h or
less.


4.8.4.3 Horizontal curves in 50 km/hr zones must have a minimum centreline radius of:


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 30/78


4.8.4.4 If reverse curves are necessary, they will have a design speed difference of no greater than
10km/h and be separate by a sufficient length of straight road to allow for development of
super-elevation reversal at no greater than 2.5m/s/s (where the design speed is greater than
50km/hr).


4.8.4.5 Curves in the same direction (i.e. broken back) in close proximity are not permitted.


**4.8.5** **Safe Stopping Sight Distances**


Safe Stopping Sight Distance (SSSD) is the distance required for a vehicle to safely stop between the
time when the driver reacts to a conflict situation and the time the vehicle comes to rest.


4.8.5.1 Table 4-9 shows acceptable SSSD for various design speeds. For full details refer Austroads
Guide to Road Design: Part 3 – Geometric Design, section 5.3.


4.8.5.2 SSSD is important in the design of ‘Unclassified Roads’ (roads that generally do not require a
centreline to be marked) to ensure that sufficient visibility is provided between opposing
vehicles on narrow carriageways to see each other and stop.


4.8.5.3 SSSD is also important to ensure adequate inter-visibility between transport users and to
provide visibility to traffic management devices.


**Table 4-9** **Safe Stopping Sight Distance**

|DesignSpeed<br>≤30km/h|SafeStoppingSightDistance(m)<br>R 2 .0s *<br>T =<br>25|

|60 km/h|73|
|70 km/h|92|
|80 km/h|114|
|90 km/h|139|
|100 km/h|165|



 - As required on level grade. Correction factors are to be applied on non-level
roads in a manner that is consistent with Austroads Guide to Road Design:
Part 3 – Geometric Design section 5.3. See Table 4-10 below.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 31/78


**Table 4-10 Corrections due to Grade - metres**







|Corrections<br>duetograde|8%<br>-|6%<br>-|4%<br>-|2%<br>-|2%|4%|6%|8%|

4.8.5.4 SSSD is measured both in relation to vertical and horizontal curvature as illustrated in







**Figure 4-8 Measurement of Safe Stopping Sight Distance**


4.8.5.5 On roads where two times the SSSD cannot be achieved, a centreline must be marked. This is
likely to require the banning of kerbside parking and may require carriageway widening.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 32/78


**4.9 Intersection Design**


This section provides standards and guidance on matters relating to intersection design.


**Mandatory Requirements**


The following matters are required in the design of intersections:


**4.9.1** **General**


4.9.1.1 Intersections will be designed to improve the legibility of the transport network and reinforce the
function of the intersecting roads as defined by the road hierarchy.


4.9.1.2 The design of unsignalised and signalised intersections will be in accordance with Austroads
Guide to Road Design Part 4A – Unsignalised and Signalised Intersections.


4.9.1.3 The design of roundabouts will be in accordance with Austroads Guide to Road Design Part 4B
– Roundabouts.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 33/78


4.9.1.4 The design of cycle facility intersections will be in accordance with NZTA’s Cycling Network
Guidance and Austroads Guide to Road Design Part 6A Paths for Walking and Cycling.


4.9.1.5 The road marking and sign layout at all intersections types will be in accordance with the NZTA
Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings (MOTSAM) and NZTA Traffic Control Devices Manual.


4.9.1.6 Intersections will not be designed to be a stop control.


**4.9.2** **Sight Distances**


4.9.2.1 Safe Intersection Site Distance (SISD) is the minimum sight distance that should be available
from intersection legs with priority to vehicles which could emerge from non-signalised legs. It is
measured along the carriageway from the approaching vehicle to the conflict point. For full
details refer Austroads Guide to Road Design: Part 4A – Unsignalised and Signalised
intersections, section 3.2.


4.9.2.2 SISD is the distance required for the driver of a vehicle on the main road to observe a vehicle
entering from a side road, decelerate and stop prior to a point of conflict. It is also generally
sufficient to enable cars to cross a major road from a side road safely.


4.9.2.3 SISD is viewed between two points 1.15m above the road surface. One point is the driver's eye
height on the leg with priority and the other represents eye height of a driver in the side road.
The driver in the side road is assumed to sit at a distance of 3.0 minimum from the lip of the
kerb or edge line projection of the major road.


4.9.2.4 SISD allows for a 3.0 second observation time for a driver on the through leg of the intersection
to detect the problem ahead for example; car from minor road stalling in through lane, plus Safe
Stopping Sight Distance (SSSD).


4.9.2.5 SISD is to be provided in accordance with Table 4-11.


**Table 4-11 Safe Intersection Sight Distance**

|SpeedEnvironment|Safe Intersection Sight Distance (m) R 2 .0s*<br>T =|
|---|---|
|≤ 30 km/hr|50|

|100 km/hr|285|
|110 km/hr +|324|



*As required on level grade. Correction factors are to be applied on non-level roads in a
manner that is consistent with Austroads Guide to Road Design: Part 4A – Unsignalised and
Signalised Intersections, see Table 4-12 below.

**4.9.3** **Kerb Radii**


4.9.3.1 Kerb radii at intersections will be small enough to:


4.9.3.2 Tracking paths on public roads will be designed in accordance with RTS 18 New Zealand “on
road tracking curves for heavy vehicles” 2007. Kerb radii at intersections will be large enough to
accommodate the turning requirements of the design vehicle as follows:


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 35/78


4.9.3.3 Consideration must always be given to narrowing the width of the carriageway at intersections
with kerb extensions to keep pedestrian crossing distances to a minimum and control turning
vehicle speeds while allowing for safe passage by cyclists.


4.9.3.4 An inside kerb radius of 5m is typically required at kerb extensions to facilitate street cleaning.


4.9.3.5 Outside Kerb radii will not be less than 3.0m.

**4.10 Private Access and Crossings**


This section outlines design standards and guidance for access to and from property to roads, including
crossings.


**Mandatory Requirements**


These standards are required in the design of private accesses and crossings:


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 37/78


**4.10.1 General**


4.10.1.1 When designing private accesses, the long-term maintenance costs for the residents must be

balanced against the benefits of providing access through a public road.


4.10.1.2 The design and construction standards, including drainage for private access must comply with

the requirements for an equivalent construction of a public road, including the 50-year design
life.


4.10.1.3 The footpath and any cycle facility will be continuous across private driveways and private

access to ensure priority to footpath and cycle facility users is reinforced.


4.10.1.4 The private access will provide for utility services.

1 Means any discrete household unit/dwelling or business unit.

2 Where a shared private access in all zones is more than 50m long, a passing bay will be provided (at the start of the Row Tasman District and) at least once every 50m


(see 4.10.2.5).

3 Gradients up to 1-in-4.5 can be used on straight lengths over distance of up to 20m.See also 4.10.3 (transition grades).

4 Sealed surface if grade is 1:5 or steeper.
5 Where the proposed private access way is designed with a legal reserve width of 4.5m or less, more detailed design information will be required to satisfy the Council

that the specific design provisions will operate satisfactorily. Designers should note that these widths will make turning into and out of properties difficult so careful
detailed design will be needed.

6 Refer SD407 for urban vehicle entrance plan and SD409 for rural vehicle entrance plan.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 39/78


4.10.2.2 Where the speed limit is over 60km/h the crossing must comply with:


4.10.2.3 Not more than one crossing is provided per site. Except to facilitate on-site turning and a one
way traffic flow in Commercial and Industrial zones through a site fronting a road with a speed
limit of 50 kilometres per hour or less, provided there is at least 7.5 metres between accesses
on the same road frontage, and one access is marked "in" and the other "out".


4.10.2.4 Where a crossing from a Classified Road gives access to a car parking area containing more

than 20 spaces, a queuing area at least 15 metres long will be provided for vehicles entering
and leaving the site. The queueing area length is measured from the road boundary of the site
to the first point at which a vehicle can turn into a parking space or aisle.


4.10.2.5 Passing Bays - any passing bay will be constructed to a minimum width of 5.5m (includes

carriageway) and have a minimum length of 6.0m with a 4.0m long taper at each end.


4.10.2.6 Vehicle Gates - any gate or door will be hung to open into the site, and is set back sufficiently to

ensure that the largest class of vehicle likely to need access to the site on a regular, frequent or
predictable basis can be stopped off the road carriageway while the gate is being opened or
shut.


4.10.2.7 Culvert Diameter - the minimum diameter of culverts under driveways where the driveway

crosses a road swale drain will be 375mm diameter. Note: this shall also address secondary
flow paths so that they are contained within the swale.


4.10.2.8 The ‘Extension of Carriage way Surface’ shown in Table 4-13 is measured from road edge and

shall be concrete or match the footpath surface where one exists except:


4.10.2.9 The berm or shoulder adjacent to a private access with more than one user will be designed to

incorporate collection areas for waste and recycling wheelie bins without blocking the footpath.
The collection area will be 1.0m [2] for each property accessed from the private access.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 40/78


**4.10.3 Gradients**


Critical aspects of private access design and crossings in relation to gradient are set out in Table 4-13
with details on transitions shown in SD406 to SD409 and Figure 4-119.















**Figure 4-9 vehicle entrance grade transitions Grade changes are required to ensure vehicles will**

**not scrape their undersides. Grade transitions of 2.0m long are required whenever the**
**ramp grade changes by more than 12.5%. Refer to ‘AS/NZS 2890.1:2004 Parking**
**facilities – Part 1: Off-street car parking’ for detailed design guidance.**


4.10.3.1 Gradients of an access that crosses a footpath shall generally be as shown in SD’s 406, and

407.


4.10.3.2 Except as specifically provided for in the standards of this sub-section, the maximum gradient of

an access ramp for the first 6m from the property boundary line will be 1-in-20 (5%). Where the
following conditions are met, the grade can be increased to 1-in-8 (12.5%) for the first 6m:


4.10.3.3 On roads where the footpath is located against or close to the kerb and where the target speed

environment is 40km/h or lower, vehicle crossings will be designed with a mountable kerb.


**4.10.4 Sight Distances (other than Safe Intersection Site Distance)**


4.10.4.1 Vehicle Access Sight Distance - sight distance is measured from the motorist’s position at the

access point (2.5m back from the edge of the carriageway and at a height of 1.1 metres) in both
directions along the frontage road. Where the frontage road is one-way or is median divided,
the sight distance is only required in the direction of approaching and potentially conflicting
traffic movements.


The minimum sight distance that must be available from any vehicle access point along the frontage road
is shown in Table 4-14.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 41/78

*If the speed environment is not known, the speed environment will be taken as 10km/h
above the regulatory speed limit for the purposes of determining minimum sight distances.


Based on Austroads Guide to Road Design Part 4A: Approach Sight Distance Table 3.1.


Upgrade/downgrade corrections will be applied in accordance with Austroads Guide to Road Design Part
4A: Table 3.3.


**4.10.5 Visibility Splays**


4.10.5.1 For all vehicle access points, a minimum visibility splay with the dimensions shown in

Figure 4-10 must be provided. Items may be located within the visibility splay provided they do
not obstruct visibility to pedestrians. Generally, this means avoiding objects and vegetation with
a height of more than 0.9m.


4.10.5.2 For high volume or high safety risk vehicle access points including:


The minimum visibility splay with the dimensions shown in Figure 4-11 must be provided.


If the access is adjacent to a neighbouring property, the access may need to be moved away
from the common boundary to comply with sight visibility. The legal easement width may need
to be adjusted accordingly.


1 Vehicle orientated activities includes; Service Stations, Truck Stops, Supermarkets, Malls, Drive In/Drive
through, Detail Outlets.

2 Cycle facility = cycleway/shared path.

**4.10.6 Tracking Paths**


4.10.6.1 Except for a single dwelling that has access from a ‘Unclassified Road’ with a regulatory speed

limit of 50km/h or below; the site will provide manoeuvring space for the largest class of vehicle
likely to need access to the site on a regular, frequent or predictable basis, so that a vehicle
does not need to reverse to or from the road. The manoeuvring will use no more than three
individual movements to allow vehicles to enter and exit a site.


4.10.6.2 Tracking paths and turning circles on private land will be provided in accordance with

ASNZS 2890.1 “off-street carparking” 2004.


4.10.6.3 Vehicle access points must be located so that no part of the access, nor tracking path crosses

any part of another site except where there is a right of way or other similar legal easement over
those parts of the other site. See Figure 4-12.

**4.10.7 Minimum distance of a vehicle crossing from intersections**


4.10.7.1 No part of a vehicle crossing shall be closer to a road intersection than the distances permitted

in Table 4-15 Except when the boundaries of the site do not allow, then a single vehicle
crossing may be constructed provided it is located adjoining an internal boundary of the site in
the position which most nearly complies with the provisions of on the road ranked lower in the

**4.11 Clear Zones**


The purpose of a clear zone is to provide space for the driver of a vehicle that leaves the traffic lane to
regain control while sustaining minimum damage to the vehicle and its occupants. This section outlines
requirements and guidance for the design of them.


**Mandatory Requirements**


The following standards are required for the design of clear zones within the transportation network:


**4.11.1 General**


4.11.1.1 A clear zone must be measured from the edge of the traffic lane and is the width of roadside

available for the driver to undertake corrective action and may include the cycle facility and
footpath width.


4.11.1.2 Where it is not possible to provide an adequate clear zone, free of non-frangible obstacles for

the appropriate distance, a vehicle barrier will be erected.


4.11.1.3 Any vehicle barrier within the clear zone, must include the barrier deflection when determining

the offset between the edge line and the hazard. Guidance on the design and construction of
vehicle barriers will comply with NZTA M23 Notes ‘Notes for Road Safety Barrier Systems'
(2009).


4.11.1.4 Hazards within the clear zone also include vertical drops from features such as drains and

culverts. Any vertical drop of more than 1m within the clear zone will be considered to be a
hazard. The hazard must be removed or treated to prevent the vehicle going over the drop. A
vehicle barrier is likely to be the most common form of treatment.


4.11.1.5 To provide this zone, potential non-frangible hazards such as above ground utilities, street

furniture, street trees and lighting columns will be located at a distance from the edge of the
traffic lane greater than the widths shown in Table 4-16.


**Table 4-16 Clear Zone Widths (With Kerb)**

**4.12 Parking (on street/road)**


This section provides standards for the design of parking spaces and car parks (including accessible
carparks).


**Mandatory Requirements**


The following matters are required in the design of parking:


**4.12.1 General**


Parking is required in accordance with the requirements in Table 4-6 and Table 4-7. If indented bays are
used, they will be at least 2.2m wide and no wider than 2.5m.


4.12.1.1 One carpark per two lots is the default on street carpark requirement on ‘Unclassified’ roads if

angled or inset car park bays are provided. Where all the following conditions exist one carpark
per three lots can be provided:


4.12.1.2 Parking bays to be evenly distributed along the road at no greater spacing than 50m.


4.12.1.3 Parking spaces will commence a minimum distance of 6.0m from any side road and no closer

than 1.0m to any access.


4.12.1.4 Where parking is metered, restricted or angled individual parking spaces will be marked.


4.12.1.5 Marking is required for all parking start and end points on Arterial, Principal and Collector Roads

in Nelson.


4.12.1.6 Where angle parking is used on roads classified as sub-collector roads or higher, clear space

must be available for vehicles to manoeuvre to and from spaces completely clear of the live

**4.13 Public Transport, Footpaths, Public Accessways and Cycle Facilities**


This section deals with the design of the transport network for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport.


**Mandatory Matters**


These standards are required for the design of the transport system for pedestrians, public transportation
and cyclists:


**4.13.1 Safety from Falling**


4.13.1.1 Where people could fall 1 metre or more (except in remote locations where the route served

presents similar natural hazards) a hand rail will be provided.


4.13.1.2 Where a handrail is located adjacent to public roads the handrail will comply with SD420 to

SD424.


4.13.1.3 In other environments, such as private accesses, the balustrade may comply with the

alternative design as in SD419.


4.13.1.4 If the designer wishes to erect a balustrade of alternative design to the two above, then full

details will be submitted to the Engineering Manager for approval.


4.13.1.5 For barrier details of relevant to footpaths refer to Table 4-17 and for cycle facilities refer to

Austroads Guide to Road Design Part 6A: Paths for Walking and Cycling - section 5.5.3.


**4.13.2 Public Transport**


4.13.2.1 The development of urban land and design of transport networks must design for the

convenient access of public transport.


**4.13.3 Footpaths**


4.13.3.1 The design of footpaths will be in accordance with the requirements of the NZTA Pedestrian

Planning and Design Guide.


4.13.3.2 The number and width of footpaths are specified in Table 4-6 and Table 4-7 that are to be

provided in various planning zones. The widths specified in Table 4-6 and Table 4-7 and are
‘Through Route’ widths that must be free of all obstructions such as vegetation, light columns,
signs, utility furniture, bollards etc.


4.13.3.3 Where objects are located adjacent to a footpath a pedestrian will tend to ‘shy away’ from those

objects. In order to ensure ‘Through Route’ widths are maintained, the minimum footpath width
will be increased by 150mm where such an object is present on one side and by 300mm where
objects are present on both sides. Refer to Figure 4-13 for widening detail for footpaths of 1.5m
through width.


4.13.3.4 Where any footpath is located directly against the property boundary it must have a minimum

width of 1.65m. Where a footpath is located against a kerb, the width of the footpath excludes
the top of the kerb. Refer to Figure 4-13 for widening detail for footpaths of 1.5m through width.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 50/78


**Figure 4-13 Minimum Footpath Widths for Through Width of 1.5m**


4.13.3.5 In residential areas, footpaths will be separated from the carriageway by a berm, or cycle

facility.


4.13.3.6 All footpaths in the “Hillside Environments” require specific design to the satisfaction of the

Engineering Manager.


4.13.3.7 Critical aspects of footpath design specified in this guide that must be adhered to are presented

in SD406 and SD407.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 51/78


**Table 4-17 Critical Aspects of Footpath Design**









|Design Aspect|DesignRequirement|
|---|---|
|Gradient|The mean gradient (change in vertical elevation between the top and<br>bottom of a footpath) on any footpath should not exceed 5%.<br>The maximum gradient (change in vertical elevation measured at 0.6m<br>intervals along a footpath) will not exceed 8% for a continuous distance of<br>9m.<br>Where one or both are unavoidable, the footpath will be designed as a ramp<br>i.e.provides rest areas.|
|Crossfall|The maximum crossfall for any footpath is 2%.<br>The crossfall of any footpath must facilitate stormwater flow to on-road<br>drainage systems and not create ponding on the footpath or flow into private<br>property.|
|Vertical Drop|In situations where there is more than a 1m high drop (i.e. safety from<br>falling), within 1m of the back of a footpath, a handrail will be constructed.<br>The handrail will be located at least 150mm away from the minimum footpath<br>width (refer 4.13.3.3) and no closer than 150mm from the top of the bank.<br>Refer SD420 to SD424.|
|Overhead<br>Clearance|Footpaths will have a minimum vertical (overhead) clearance of 2.4m|


**Note**





It is acknowledged that in ‘Hillside Environments’ it may not be practical to achieve the footpath
gradients or to design the footpath as a ramp. The gradient requirements are therefore not
applicable to new roads in ‘Hillside Environments’ although careful specific design to the
satisfaction of the Engineering Manager is required.


**4.13.4 Crossings for Pedestrians and Cyclists**


4.13.4.1 Having selected the appropriate crossing facility from the guidance in Table 4-17, the facility will

be designed in accordance with the NZTA Pedestrian Planning and Design Guide.


4.13.4.2 All kerb crossing points must be designed to accommodate all potential users and to minimise

the crossing distance for pedestrians. This means ensuring:


4.13.4.3 At intersections, the kerb crossing will be offset from the intersection corner to line-up with the

desire line. Where the ramp cannot be on the desire line, or where an intersection allows
pedestrians traffic to cross the road at an angle, the kerb crossing ramp will be graded and
carried around the quadrant of the kerb corner.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 52/78


4.13.4.4 Kerb crossings will be located so that users have an unobstructed view of traffic approaching

from any direction.


4.13.4.5 Tactile paving will be installed on all new and upgraded roads at all kerb crossings and other

places where the footpath is not separated from the carriageway by an abrupt change in grade
(more than 1 in 8) or vertical kerb face (higher than 70mm). Refer SD410.


4.13.4.6 Tactile paving will provide a high visual contrast to the adjoining walking surface. ‘Safety Yellow’

is the required colour standard for tactile paving.


4.13.4.7 The layout and installation of tactile paving will be in accordance with the NZTA Road and

Traffic Guideline RTS 14 ‘Guidelines for facilities for blind and vision-impaired pedestrians.


**4.13.5 Cycle Facilities**


4.13.5.1 The design of cycle facilities will be in accordance with the NZTA Cycle Network Guidance and

Austroads Guide to Road Design Part 6A – Paths for Walking and Cycling specify the facilities
type that are to be provided by zone and hierarchy.


4.13.5.2 Where cycle facilities are provided mid-block, they will also be provided on the transition

between mid-block and intersection, on the approach to the intersection, at the intersection
(storage) and on the departure of the intersection.


4.13.5.3 Cycle facilities must be surfaced as per the minimum requirements of Section 4.22 Footpaths.


4.13.5.4 Where a cycle facility is provided within a road reserve that has frequent driveways, a buffer

between the property boundary and the path must be provided to minimise the risk of a collision
between a cyclist on the path and a vehicle exiting from a driveway.


4.13.5.5 A separation berm of 1.0m minimum must be provided between the path and carriageway

where kerbside parking is permitted to avoid conflict between cyclists and opening doors on the
left-hand side of vehicles.


4.13.5.6 A minimum lateral clearance of 0.5m (desirably 1.0m) must be provided between the edge of

the path and any obstacle, including vegetation, light standards, signs, utility furniture, bollards

etc.


4.13.5.7 Green coloured surfacing will be used at locations where motorists may be unaware of the likely

presence of cyclists, or where motorists are likely to cross over the path of cyclists (for example
at intersection transitions or across side streets or high volume private accessways). The green
coloured surface will be G26 Apple Green or G31 Verdigris as specified in AS 2700S:1996. The
supply and application of the green coloured surface will be in accordance with NZTA P33:
2017.


4.13.5.8 Cycle parking will be in accordance with AS 2890.3:2015 Bicycle Parking.


**4.13.6 Public Accessways**


4.13.6.1 The minimum legal reserve width of any public accessway will be 6m including berms and

landscaping. Refer to SD427 for detailed design information.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 53/78


4.13.6.2 Public accessways must be designed in accordance with the CPTED Guidelines so that a

person using the public accessway can see from one end of the accessway to the other at all
times.

**Mandatory Matters**


The following matters are required in the construction of road subgrades:


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 69/78


**4.18.1 Subgrade testing**


4.18.1.1 Subgrades are inherently variable in nature and reflect the changes in topography, soil type,

and drainage conditions that generally occur along an existing or proposed road alignment. The
selection of a subgrade design value requires adequate consideration of the degree of
variability within a particular project section and the quantity and quality of data on subgrade
properties. Subgrade test sites will be:


**4.18.2 Subgrade Drainage**


4.18.2.1 Subgrade and subsoil drainage will be designed and installed in accordance with TNZ F/2 and

F/7 specifications and the accompanying notes.


4.18.2.2 When the road or private accessway is in-cut, a sub-soil drain will be placed below the toe of

the batter and connected into the back of the nearest sump downstream.


4.18.2.3 Any permanent wet spot in the subgrade or any area undercut below adjacent sub-soil drains

will be connected to the nearest piped stormwater system by another sub-soil drain. Where the
drain is located under the carriageway, traffic loading will be taken into consideration for the
type of pipe.


4.18.2.4 In areas of high groundwater or where the road pavement design is reliant on the subgrade

remaining dry, it may be necessary to install a sub-soil drainage system piped to the nearest
stormwater system to prevent excessive moisture getting into to the subgrade.









Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 70/78

The following matters are requirements for the formation of residential lanes, service lanes and private

ways:


**4.20.1 General**


4.20.1.1 The finished surface will have a crossfall of 1-in-33 (3%) and shaped with a crown or mono

crossfall.


4.20.1.2 All topsoil and growth will be removed and compacted basecourse and sub basecourse (where

required) laid and graded to an even surface.


4.20.1.3 The pavement will be designed as detailed in Section 4.17 ‘Structural Design of Pavement’.


4.20.1.4 All formations are to be surfaced in accordance with Section 4.19 ‘Carriageway Surfacing’.


4.20.1.5 Kerb and channelling on private ways on at least one side for the full length of the private way

with the crossfall towards it will be required when any of the following are present:


4.20.1.6 For residential lanes, kerb and channel will be provided on the footpath side for the full length

and the crossfall will fall towards this. A nib kerb, or similar, will be provided on the other side for
the full length of the residential lane.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 74/78


4.20.1.7 At intersections of residential lanes, service lanes and private ways with higher order roads a

standard access crossing will be constructed (SD406) so that the footpath and kerb runs
through. This is to signal to drivers they are entering slow shared space and give pedestrians
right of way on the higher order alignment.


4.20.1.8 For service lanes, kerb and channel will be provided on both sides for the full length.


4.20.1.9 The high side of the formation will be retained by either of the following: kerb and channel, nib

kerb


4.20.1.10 The kerb and channel will be constructed in accordance with Section 4.21 ‘Kerb and


Channelling’.


4.20.1.11 For private ways more than 10m in length or more than 30m2 of sealed surface, all stormwater

off the formation will be collected and discharged to an approved stormwater system.


4.20.1.12 Sumps will be located at the low side of the formation within kerb and channel (or similar) and at

the street boundary where falls are towards the carriageway. New sumps will not be permitted
within a vehicle access point on the line of the street kerb and channel (or edge of seal where
there is no kerb and channel).





**4.21 Kerb and Channelling**


This section sets out conditions for design and construction of kerb and channelling.


**Mandatory Matters**


The following matters are required in the design and construction of kerb and channelling associated with
road construction:


**4.21.1 General**


4.21.1.1 Concrete restraint in the form of kerb and channel, nib kerb or mountable kerbing will be

provided in all urban areas on both sides of the pavement formation to confine the pavement
layers and control stormwater.


4.21.1.2 The minimum grade will be 1:250.


4.21.1.3 A minimum depth of 100mm of compacted base course will be placed under the kerb and

channel. Compaction will be to a minimum of 98% of maximum dry density.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 75/78


4.21.1.4 If unsuitable soil conditions are encountered at the base of kerb and channel excavations, the

site will be trenched out below this depth and backfilled with gravel or other approved fill
material in layers of a thickness that is compatible with the type of compaction equipment and
material being used.


4.21.1.5 The concrete will comply with specified requirements of High-Grade Concrete in NZS 3104:

‘Specification for concrete production’.


4.21.1.6 The profiles will conform to SD404.


4.21.1.7 Slip form kerb machines will be used were practical however when not suitable formwork for

kerb and channel will be approved dressed timber, steel or aluminium alloy sections adequately
oiled or otherwise treated to allow ease of striking without staining of the stripped concrete
surface. All formwork will be accurately placed to the lines and levels of the works and will be
such as to give the finished kerbs smooth and pleasing lines free of kinks and angles.


4.21.1.8 Control joints (for shrinkage control) will be installed at 5.0m intervals. Where the kerb intersects

into crossover or undergoes a sharp change in direction the first shrinkage control will be
positioned at this point or no further than 2m from the point. The control joint will be provided by
a knife-edge cutting while the concrete is still plastic to at least a quarter of the depth of the
concrete thickness.


4.21.1.9 The contractor must manage early concrete setting to avoid shrinkage cracking occurring

between control joints. If the kerb is adjacent to a concrete footpath, then the control joint will
coincide with the concrete footpath joints.


4.21.1.10 Kerb entries can only be installed with the Engineering Manager’s approval.


4.21.1.11 Kerbs and channels will be finished such that on straight portions there is no deviation of more

than 5mm within the length of a 3m straight edge; nor a deviation of more than 5mm from the
line and level.


4.21.1.12 Kerbing and channelling be finished with a steel float and any concrete work showing

honeycombing or scale in the face is to be removed and replaced.


4.21.1.13 All repairs to damaged kerb must be made prior to footpath surfacing.


4.21.1.14 Kerb crossings will be designed and constructed in accordance with SD404 and SD405.


4.21.1.15 When constructing curves, the use of regular forms to produce a chorded effect will not be

accepted.


4.21.1.16 Changes of grade will be made with a smooth vertical curve, and horizontal curves will be

circular or transition as required by section 4.8.4.


**4.21.2 Benchmarks**


4.21.2.1 The Designer will install Councils’ standard benchmark plaques on the top of the kerb. A

minimum of one plaque will be installed in each new street, at maximum intervals of 300m.


4.21.2.2 Where a plaque is installed to meet the requirement of Land Information NZ (LINZ) and it is

installed on top of the kerb, this may be used as the benchmark and the Nelson City Council or
Tasman District Council plaque omitted.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 4 – Transportation Page 76/78


4.21.2.3 The proposed location will be shown on the engineering plans. The Designer will establish a

reduced level and coordinates on each new benchmark and show this on the as-built plans to
two decimal places.


4.21.2.4 Benchmark plaques will be supplied by the Council at no cost to the Designer.

**CHAPTER 5** **STORMWATER**


**INTRODUCTION**


**5** **PURPOSE**


The purpose of this section is to outline standards and good practice matters for the design and
construction of stormwater systems for land development and subdivision in the Nelson and Tasman
Districts. These aim to achieve flood management, environmental and amenity expectations in an effective
and efficient matter. In all situations the provisions of the Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual
(NTLDM) are also subject to the applicable Resource Management Plan (RMP).


The performance outcomes for the design and construction of stormwater systems sought by the standards
and good practice matters in this document are as follows:


a) A management solution that is based on a holistic catchment-based assessment, including
consideration of topography, soil and slope, vegetation, built development, existing drainage
patterns, freshwater resources, stormwater network infrastructure, natural values and natural
hazards;


b) An integrated design approach to stormwater management, which accommodates stormwater
functions including access for maintenance and operations, as well as amenity, recreation and
ecological values;


c) A network that manages stormwater flows to a standard that minimises people and property from
harm or damage and nuisance effects, especially from risk to safety, health and well-being;


d) A management approach that aims to improve water quality;


e) Devices and design solutions that are robust, durable and easily maintained;


f) A whole-of-life operations, maintenance and replacement or renewal programme that is clearly
described, costed, and can be afforded;


g) A stormwater system design that takes into account the foreseeable demands of future
development;


h) A resilient network infrastructure that performs well against the risk of geotechnical, seismic, flood
hazards and coastal hazards (erosion and inundation);


i) A design that maintains or improves values associated with freshwater resources, including riparian
management and in-stream habitat values;


j) Stormwater assets that have high amenity value, and shared use of open-space areas where
practicable and agreed to by Reserves and Facilities Manager;


k) A network that maintains a high visual amenity that enhances the value of adjoining property and
neighbourhood values as a whole.


All performance outcomes are also subject to the applicable Resource Management Plan objectives and
policies and appropriate bylaws, which take precedence over the requirements of the Nelson Tasman Land
Development Manual (NTLDM).


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual – September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 5 – Stormwater Page 1/38


The requirements set out in this chapter address matters that are specific to Council asset creation or
activities that may have an impact on an asset. They are subject to the Nelson City and Tasman District
Resource Management Plans as well as relevant National Environmental Standards and National Policy
Statement: Freshwater Management.


Stormwater is also regulated within the Building Act and NZ Building Code (NZBC). As part of the building
consent application process, stormwater run-off must be addressed by providing appropriate plans and
specifications that demonstrate compliance with the performance requirements of NZBC clause E1,
“Surface Water”. The information required includes, but is not limited to, the size, fall (gradient) and setting
out of the drainage, details of surface water sumps (eg. for drainage of a driveway surface), and provision
of access points.


In addition to the standards of this document, the standards set out in Table 5-1 also apply unless specified
otherwise. Where an Act or National Standards document is referenced, this shall be the current version
including any associated amendments.

**Schuler, 1996 and Auckland Council TR035/2013).**


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 5 – Stormwater Page 4/38


**Note:**


The distribution of rainfall events can be divided into three classes by recurrence interval. The first class
has the most frequent rainfall events, which are targeted for water quality control and ground water
recharge. Storms in zones two and three are water quantity storms, for which the control objectives are
channel erosion and flood control (adapted from Clayton & Schuler, 1996).


**Table 5-3** **Effects of Stormwater Discharges**














|Col1|Effectsonthe<br>receiving<br>environment|Resultingfrom|RequiredMitigation|
|---|---|---|---|
|Zone 1|Water quality|Urban land uses such as roading,<br>parking, industrial zones and certain<br>building materials generate<br>contaminants that are picked up by<br>stormwater runoff and accumulate in<br>freshwater and marine water receiving<br>environments|Treatment of stormwater runoff in<br>accordance with Section 5.4.7<br>and 5.4.8.|
|Zone 2|Streambank<br>erosion and<br>degradation of<br>stream health|An increase in impervious surface leads<br>to increased runoff volumes and flow<br>velocities during frequently occurring<br>rainfall events. Impervious surface also<br>leads to reduced groundwater recharge<br>and base flows during dry periods.|Infiltration and slowing down flow<br>velocities in accordance with<br>Section 5.4.9 – 5.4.11.|
|Zone 3|Increased risk<br>of downstream<br>flooding|An increase in impervious surface leads<br>to increased peak flows and flow<br>velocities|Provide detention in accordance<br>with Section 5.4.12 – 5.4.15.|



a) Protect and enhance the values and functions of natural ecosystems;


b) Address stormwater effects as close to source as possible;


c) Mimic natural systems and processes for stormwater management;


d) Support inter-disciplinary planning and design where practicable and;


e) WSD principles shall be considered during the initial design and planning.


**Note:**


Effective implementation of WSD principles requires more planning and design input than traditional piped
stormwater systems. Good planning and design early in the development process maximises the cost
effectiveness of WSD. Further guidance on the implementation of WSD is available in the Auckland Council
guideline document GD2015/004 (Water Sensitive Design for Stormwater).

a) Private drain – drain serving one property;


b) Common private drain – drain serving two to five properties;


c) Public drain – drain serving six properties or more and/or covered by easement in gross or is

within road reserve.


a) Maintenance purposes;


b) Preserving the route for relaying the reticulation in the future;


c) Avoiding likely positions for buildings, garages, carports and retaining walls; and


d) Located on the northern side of dwellings.


a) Within ROWs or driveways;


b) Outside probable building envelopes;


c) Clear of obstructions;


d) Adjacent to boundaries – but no closer than 0.6m to outside edge of the pipe or structure;


e) Parallel to boundaries.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 5 – Stormwater Page 8/38


This section outlines stormwater system design requirements relating to the key components of the total
system and the capacity of them.


The following matters are mandatory requirements for the design of the stormwater system.


a) Natural systems such as streams (ephemeral, intermittent and permanent) and overland flow

paths; and


b) Built systems such as constructed channels and drains, piped networks, manholes, inlets/

outlets, stormwater quality treatment devices (i.e. wetlands, swales, raingardens etc),
detention dams, diversion devices, and pump stations.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual – September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 5 – Stormwater Page 9/38


a) Aligned with natural flow paths wherever possible;


b) Via roads, public walkways or right of ways wherever possible;


c) Kept clear of proposed building sites;


d) Protected by legal easements in favour of Council;


e) Subject to an encumbrance placed on the title of the land which prohibits ground reshaping

and the erection of any barriers to the secondary flows;


f) Appropriately formed and/or hardened to make their presence obvious and durable;


g) Designed for public safety.


a) Legal easements in favour of Council and;


b) Consent notice on the title (top of bank to top of bank) to protect the drain or flowpath from

development.


Pedestrian safety dflow x vave < 0.3 m [2] /s


Vehicle safety The height of the total energy line (water level + energy head) shall not exceed
300 mm above roadway surface at the low point of the cross section.


Flow along the road should not exceed dflow x vave < 0.3 m [2] /s, except with
specific floodway design and additional protection.


Where:

dflow = flow depth in the channel adjacent to the kerb, eg, measured from the invert of the

channel (m).
vave = average flow velocity of the flow (m/s).


**Note:**


- A maximum depth is required for vehicle safety because small cars can float in depths exceeding
300mm.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 5 – Stormwater Page 10/38


- Any sites that do not comply with the above thresholds require approval from the Engineering Manager
and shall be clearly identified on engineering plans.


On new subdivisions lot/section, levels (where practicable) shall have the minimum finished
ground level being greater than the crown level of the road to which the pipe storm water from
the allotment is drained.

|---|---|
|Non-habitable residential buildings and detachedgarages|0.2m|
|Commercial and industrial buildings|0.3m|
|Habitable dwelling (including attachedgarages)|0.5m|
|Major community facilities related to supply of electricity,<br>telecommunications, water supply or wastewater disposal|0.6m|
|Bridges and buildings over watercourses (freeboard to underside of<br>structure)|0.6m|


**Note:**





i) Structures need to comply with freeboard requirements of the NZ building code and those may be
separate from and in addition to freeboard requirements in Table 5-4.


ii) Specific freeboard requirements apply to areas that are at risk of coastal inundation and shall be in

accordance with Inundation Practice Note: Calculating minimum ground and floor levels for subdivision
and new buildings, Tasman District Council and Nelson City Council, March 2019.


iii) Any proposed deviation from the freeboard requirements in Table 5-4 shall be approved by the

Engineering Manager.


a) 500mm where surface water has a depth of 100mm or more and extends from the building

directly to a road or carpark, other than a carpark for a single dwelling.


b) 150mm for all other cases


**Note:**


The 500mm freeboard allows for waves generated by vehicles. Such waves will not be sustained unless
there is at least 100mm depth of water and an unobstructed path from the point where the wave is
generated to the building.

**Note** :

Design considerations for soft engineering are site-specific and their implementation should be carefully
considered on a case-by-case basis.


a) Infiltration of stormwater into the ground and;


b) Extended detention.


Infiltration is an integral part of natural drainage processes and shall be integrated into the design of the
stormwater system. Infiltration reduces stormwater runoff and contributes to groundwater recharge and


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual – September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 5 – Stormwater Page 15/38


base flows in streams. Infiltration of stormwater for greenfield, infill and brownfield developments shall be
provided in accordance with Table 5-7 below.


**Table 5-7** **Infiltration Requirements**

|---|---|
|Development, greenfield, infill or<br>brownfield that creates no additional<br>impervious area or where impervious<br>surface is reduced.|None required.|
|Development, greenfield, infill or<br>brownfield, located outside<br>groundwater recharge zones*.|None required.|
|Development, greenfield, infill or<br>brownfield, creating additional<br>impervious surface greater than 50m2<br>and is located within groundwater<br>recharge zones*.|A minimum of 5 mm of runoff from the newly created<br>impervious surfaces* shall be infiltrated within 24 hours to<br>offset the loss of the initial abstraction of 5 mm of rainfall that<br>uncompacted pre-development pervious areas have.<br>*If at the time of consent application, the total newly created<br>impervious surface is unknown, the developer should take into<br>account an estimated total new impervious surface, based on<br>the anticipated future use of the site and maximum allowable<br>coverage percentage under the relevant zoning rules.|


**Note:**


- Recharge zones are defined as:





i) Areas that are identified as having low risk for slope stability issues;


ii) Areas with a permeability rate of at least 5mm/hr (as determined through permeability test method
described in in E1/VM1 Section 9.0); and


iii) Areas with a seasonal high ground water table no less than one meter below the surface.


Extended detention is required to detain and slow down flows from frequently occurring storm events.
Extended detention of stormwater for greenfield, infill and brownfield developments shall be provided in
accordance with Table 5-8 below.

**CHAPTER 6** **WASTEWATER**


**INTRODUCTION**


**6** **PURPOSE**


The purpose of this section is to outline Council’s requirements for the provision of wastewater
reticulation. The Standards aim to provide for the collection and disposal of wastewater to a Councilowned treatment and disposal facility. The reticulation must address health and safety, water quality and
whole-of-life efficiency and effectiveness, regardless of the size and scale of development.


**6.1** **Performance Outcomes**


Performance outcomes for wastewater network assets sought by these standards are set out below. They
are subject to the objectives, policies and rules of the Nelson and Tasman RMPs:


a) Wastewater reticulation that ensures human health and safety;


b) Connectivity to or compatibility with existing networks;


c) Reticulation that allows for future development within the catchment or adjoining catchments;


d) Reticulation that provides individual connection for all newly created allotments;


e) Reticulation that is affordable, including maintenance and operations, replacement and renewal
costs of the whole-of-life of the system;


f) Accessibility for maintenance and repair works, with a minimum of disruption;


g) A system that avoids ingress and egress from stormwater drainage.


All performance outcomes are also subject to the applicable RMP objectives and policies and appropriate
wastewater supply bylaws, which take precedence over the requirements of the Nelson Tasman Land
development Manual (NTLDM).


**6.2** **Referenced Documents**


**6.2.1** **Regional Plan Requirements**


The standards set out in this chapter address matters that are specific to Council asset creation or
activities that may have an impact on an asset. They are subject to the respective Nelson and Tasman
RMPs. Key sections of the Plans that may be relevant to wastewater management asset design and
construction are subdivision and discharge provisions.


**6.2.2** **Building Consent**


As well as the requirements of the NTLDM, the Building Act and NZ Building Code (NZBC) requirements
also apply to individual connections to Council’s wastewater reticulation. A building consent application is
required and is to be supported with the appropriate plans and specifications (Section 45 of the Building
Act 2004). These must demonstrate compliance with the performance requirements of NZBC clause G13
(“foul water”).


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 6 - Wastewater Page 1/30


The information required includes, but is not limited to, the size, fall (gradient) and setting out of the
proposed drainage, details of access points for maintenance, provision for ventilation and proximity to any
buildings.


**6.2.3** **External Standards**


Unless otherwise specified within the standards of this document, wastewater networks will be designed
and constructed in a manner consistent with the standards set out in Table 6-1. Where an Act or National

Standard document is referenced, this will be the current version including any associated amendments.

**STANDARDS**


**6.3** **Reticulation Design**


This section sets out Council’s expectations for general design standards for wastewater reticulation,
including private connections, trade waste and reticulation layout.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met in the design of the wastewater supply reticulation.


**6.3.1** **General**


6.3.1.1 Wastewater disposal will be provided to every lot by means of a connection to a reticulated
wastewater system.


6.3.1.2 All systems will be designed to accommodate the flow from upstream of the subdivision or
development and will be of sufficient capacity to provide for maximum flow from possible future
development.


6.3.1.3 The Designer will eliminate retention of wastewater in piped systems and potential for
wastewater to become anaerobic and produce gases by:


a) making use of adequate grades for self-cleansing and slime control;


b) avoiding use of wastewater pumping stations where possible;


c) ensuring adequate ventilation of stale wastewater; and


d) avoiding any unnecessary turbulence at junctions and changes in grades, particularly where

rising mains enter the gravity system at drop junctions.


6.3.1.4 In specific circumstances, individual lot low-flow pressure pumping systems that comply with
Council’s requirements will be permitted.


6.3.1.5 Under no circumstances will wastewater reticulation be connected to stormwater reticulation or

drains.


6.3.1.6 Wastewater reticulation will be provided for the full length of each new road/street, unless
approved otherwise by Council.


6.3.1.7 Under no circumstances will glue joints be permitted to be used in jointing straight lengths of
pipe.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 6 - Wastewater Page 3/30


**6.3.2** **Connections**


6.3.2.1 Council responsibility does not extend to private connections within the lot, private pumping
systems and rising mains, which remain the responsibility of the users they serve.


6.3.2.2 No new reticulation is to be connected to Council existing operational reticulation unless the
new reticulation has been checked and is free of all debris materials.


6.3.2.3 In all subdivisions, a 100mm minimum diameter wastewater connection will be provided to at
least 1.0m inside the boundary of every lot with an inspection tee installed on the road side of
the boundary - before it connects to the private sewer lateral.


6.3.2.4 Wastewater laterals, pipes and end caps will be painted red (stormwater will be painted green),
see SD611 for the inspection tee at the boundary.


6.3.2.5 The end of each lateral will be marked by a 75mm x 25mm ground-treated marker stake
suitably identified and partly painted red.


6.3.2.6 Pipes will be laid to achieve a minimum cover of 600mm at the boundary and be deep enough
to provide gravity service from the building site.


6.3.2.7 Each connection will be adequate to serve the lot and to have a self-cleansing velocity flowing
full.


6.3.2.8 The minimum lid level of any gully trap for all new dwellings will not be less than 150mm above
the lid level of the manhole on the public wastewater sewer immediately upstream of the lateral
connection.


6.3.2.9 To be classified as public wastewater, reticulation must be inspected, approved and designated
as such by Council.


**6.3.3** **Trade Waste**


6.3.3.1 Any proposal to discharge contaminated stormwater to the wastewater network will require a
Trade Waste application.


6.3.3.2 To ensure uncontaminated stormwater does not enter the wastewater system, any area being
served by the silt and oil trap must be roofed and have a low bund around the perimeter with a
minimum height of at least 50mm.


6.3.3.3 For premises where food is prepared, a grease trap will be provided. The grease trap will meet
the requirements of the New Zealand Building Code G13 acceptable solution 2 type in ground
grease trap.


6.3.3.4 An application to Council for a Trade Waste approval will be required. Building consents are
required for all works together with a monitoring programme.


6.3.3.5 In respect of Trade Waste, Council will be notified if the premises changes discharge practices.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 6 – Wastewater Page 4/30


**6.4** **Layout and Alignment of Reticulation**


This section sets out Council’s expectations for the location of wastewater services and includes
standards that relate to wastewater in road reserve, private property, easements and the crossing of other

services.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met in the layout and location of wastewater reticulation:


**6.4.1** **General**


6.4.1.1 Wastewater reticulation will be aligned within public areas such as roads wherever possible.


**6.4.2** **Reticulation in Roads**


6.4.2.1 Wastewater reticulation in roads will be aligned parallel to kerb lines within the carriageway to
ensure that they do not clash with other services or occupy the full carriageway width.


6.4.2.2 Wastewater manholes will not be located adjacent to kerb and channel or at low points in the
finished ground surface to minimise the possibility of surface water infiltration into the
wastewater system.


6.4.2.3 Adequate clearance from other services and kerb lines will be maintained to allow for:


a) Excavation on existing services;


b) The future relaying of the drains; and


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 6 - Wastewater Page 5/30


c) The provision of additional future services.


6.4.2.4 In curved roads, reticulation will generally follow the road alignment in straight lines on such
alignment that the reticulation does not occupy the full carriageway width.


**6.4.3** **Reticulation through Private Property**


6.4.3.1 The catchment area to be served by public wastewater reticulation aligned through private
property will be kept to an absolute minimum.


6.4.3.2 In planning the layout of wastewater reticulation through private property consideration will be
given to preserving access to the pipelines for:


a) Maintenance purposes;


b) Preserving the route for relaying the reticulation in the future; and


c) Avoiding likely positions for buildings, garages, carports and retaining walls.


6.4.3.3 Where, as part of a subdivision or development, existing and/or proposed public wastewater
reticulation will be located in private property, an easement will be required in favour of the
Council.


**6.4.4** **Easements for Wastewater Reticulation**


6.4.4.1 The width of easement will be central on the centre line of the reticulation and calculated as the

general easement width of 3m, plus the diameter of the pipe and the pipe depth of the
excavation. (Or at the discretion of the Engineering Manager)


6.4.4.2 The standard wording required on the Easement Document will be:


“Memorandum Easement in Gross will be provided in favour of the respective Council to convey
sewage in a pipe and to provide unrestricted access along the line of the pipe for maintenance
and renewal work.”


**6.4.5** **Crossing other services**


6.4.5.1 Diagonal crossing of other services, including kerb lines and boundaries or fence lines, at acute
angles less than 45 degrees will be avoided wherever possible.









Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 6 – Wastewater Page 6/30


**6.5** **Pipe Design**


This section sets out Council’s requirements for design of wastewater supply reticulation pipes.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met in the design of all pipe work that makes up the

wastewater reticulation:


**6.5.1** **Pressure Reticulation Pipe Material**


6.5.1.1 All public pressure wastewater reticulation will be PE 100 pipes complying with AS/NZS4130.
All pressure reticulation should be subject to specific design for cyclic dynamic stresses
(fatigue), in selection of pipe pressure class and complying with PIPA Technical Guidelines:
POP010A Polyethylene Pipes – Design for dynamic stresses; and POP010B Fusion Fittings for
use with Polyethylene Pressure Pipes – Design for Dynamic Stresses.


6.5.1.2 For pressure sewer rising mains, the design will consider GRB to AS 3571.1, or PVC-O to
AS/NZS4441. These products are not subject to or highly resistant to fatigue and are commonly
used internationally for this purpose.


**6.5.2** **Calculation of Flow**


6.5.2.1 The parameters for calculating the design flow from residential catchments are:


a) Average dry weather flow (ADWF) = 225 litres per day per person;


b) Number of people per dwelling = 2.5;


c) Dry weather diurnal peaking factor (PF) = 2;


d) Dilution/infiltration factor for wet weather = 3;


e) Therefore, the peak wet weather flow (PWWF) is equivalent to 6 times the ADWF;


f) Flows should be based upon an 18-hour day.


**6.5.3** **Area/Zoning Coefficients**


6.5.3.1 For catchments of mixed zones or where the number of potential dwellings is not known,
wastewater flows will be calculated using the area/zoning coefficients given below in Table 6-2.
The 'area' is that area within a zone comprising lots, roadways, esplanade reserves and
neighbourhood parks. Major reserves will be excluded.


6.5.3.2 Where more than one zone contributes to the wastewater reticulation to be designed, the
wastewater discharge from each zone will be calculated using the individual zone area
multiplied by the appropriate discharge per hectare as for the total catchment area (not the
individual zone area).


6.5.3.3 The total catchment discharge is the sum of the individual zone discharges as calculated above.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 6 - Wastewater Page 7/30


**Table 6-2 Wastewater Area/Zoning Coefficients**















|ResidentialZone|TotalCatchmentArea(hectares)|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Residential Zone**|0 to 2|Over 2 to 8|Over 8 to 80|Over 80 to 200|Over 200|
|Low Density|0. 81|0. 69|0. 58|0. 45|0. 32|
|Normal/Standard<br>Density|0. 94|0. 81|0. 68|0. 53|0. 38|
|High Density|1. 08|0. 96|0. 84|0. 65|0. 47|


**Note:** The catchment area is defined as the total gravity catchment upstream of the point being considered.


**6.5.4** **Pipe Size for Gravity Sewer**


6.5.4.1 The minimum permissible diameter for new wastewater reticulation aligned in the road reserve
will be 150mm.


6.5.4.2 The minimum permissible diameter for all other new wastewater reticulation is 150mm except
as detailed below.


6.5.4.3 When an Infill Subdivision, Development, or Cross Lease Subdivision (hereinafter referred to as
Infill Development) occurs in an area served by an existing 100mm diameter wastewater drain,
it will be upgraded to 150mm diameter to the lesser requirement as follows:


a) From the point in the wastewater reticulation where there are a maximum of five residential

units being served by the 100mm diameter wastewater drain downstream until the
reticulation is at least 150mm diameter;


b) From the point of connection of the property being developed downstream until the

reticulation is at least 150mm diameter;


c) Where 100mm diameter - wastewater reticulation is required to be upgraded to 150mm

diameter or where it is proposed to lay 100mm diameter wastewater reticulation, an
Engineering Drawing including the longitudinal section will be provided.


6.5.4.4 Where infill development results in the existing private drain becoming public wastewater
reticulation, the existing pipe will be:


a) Pressure and CCTV tested to prove that it is sound to the satisfaction of the Engineering

Manager where it is 150mm or larger, or re-laid;


b) Surface opening access points will be required at every change in direction or change in

grade. In general, the minimum access point will be a rodding point but inspection bends,
mini-manholes or standard 1050mm diameter manholes may be required in appropriate
circumstances.


**6.5.5** **Reuse of Existing Service Connections**


6.5.5.1 A proposal to reuse an existing service will only be approved if the service is of adequate size
and condition and one of the following conditions applies:


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 6 – Wastewater Page 8/30


a) It can be established that the service is less than 40 years old and Pressure and CCTV
tested to prove that it is sound to the satisfaction of the Engineering Manager and has
adequate surface opening access points along its length


b) The service is to continue supplying the same building that it was originally intended for,
and no others;


6.5.5.2 This policy applies only to the Council portion of the wastewater lateral ie. from the reticulation
up to the Boundary inspection.


**6.5.6** **Disconnections**


6.5.6.1 Redundant services will be disconnected from the Wastewater reticulation by Council’s
approved contractor at the main reticulation.


6.5.6.2 The service fitting lateral will be removed or plugged at the connection to the Wastewater
reticulation. All cost associated with the disconnection will be recovered by Council from the
landowner requiring the disconnection.


**6.5.7** **Grades and Velocities**


6.5.7.1 All wastewater reticulation will be designed to utilise velocity and flow characteristics to improve
hydraulic performance and minimise settlement of solids and future maintenance costs.


6.5.7.2 The same roughness factor will be adopted for all pipe materials to account for sewer slimes,
grit deposits and other in situ variables such as construction performance and pipeline
deterioration with age.


**Table 6-3 Minimum Velocity and Grade Requirements**

**Note:**


Data presented in Table 6-3 approximates a pipe roughness equivalent to ks = 1.5mm for the “Colebrook
White” formula or "rough concrete" for the Mears Water Flow Calculator.


6.5.7.3 Submission of catchment flow plans and calculations will be required on submission of the
design plans for all reticulation serving more than 150 residential (or equivalent) units, or where
the minimum grades and flows do not comply with Table 6-3.


**6.5.8** **Pipe Cover**


6.5.8.1 Generally shallow wastewater reticulation, less than 1.2m in depth, will be avoided. Shallow
wastewater reticulation limits the area which may be adequately serviced and limits the
surcharge capacity in the case of blockage before overflow occurs.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 6 - Wastewater Page 9/30


6.5.8.2 Pipe systems will be designed to ensure the minimum cover over the barrel as set out in
Table 6-4.


**Table 6-4 Minimum Cover**






|LocationofDrain|MinimumCoverforAllPipes|
|---|---|
|Areas subject to highway traffic loading eg. within road carriageway|750mm|
|Areas subject to light traffic loading outside road, eg ROWs, driveways,<br>carparks and berms|600mm|



6.5.8.3 Minimum cover may be reduced providing the reticulation is concrete encased for concrete
pipes and concrete capped for PE/PVC and subject to the Councils’ approval.


6.5.8.4 Where reticulation with inadequate cover requires concrete protection, this will be constructed in
compliance with a specific design to the Engineering Manager’s approval.


6.5.8.5 To avoid reflective cracking of pavements and differential settlement, concrete protection will
not be permitted to penetrate the basecourse or pavement construction.


6.5.8.6 No concrete protection will be placed around the reticulation until the line has been inspected
and approved by the Council. Reticulation testing will be undertaken after the concrete
protection has been completed.


6.5.8.7 Reduced cover on reticulation may be approved without additional concrete protection providing
the appropriate class of pipe is specified and cover is according to the pipe manufacturer’s
specification.


6.5.8.8 Wastewater reticulation will be no deeper than 2.5m below finished ground levels.

6.9.4.1 The contractor will provide trench support to comply with the requirements of relevant New
Zealand legislation.


6.9.4.2 The contractor will ensure that the sides of the trench are sufficiently supported so that cracking
of the surrounding ground does not occur.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 6 - Wastewater Page 19/30


6.9.4.3 The contractor will comply with health and safety legislation.


**6.9.5** **Dewatering**


6.9.5.1 Excavations will be kept free of water during construction.


6.9.5.2 In no circumstances will stormwater or ground water be allowed to drain into any existing
wastewater reticulation and pipe ends will be plugged to prevent such ingress.


6.9.5.3 Discharge of stormwater or groundwater to existing stormwater drains or the pipes already laid
will be permitted providing adequate silt traps prevent debris and suspended matter from
entering drains.


6.9.5.4 Should deposits in existing stormwater drains or the pipes already laid occur as a result of the
operations of the Developer or the contractor, such deposits will be cleared forthwith at the
Developer’s or the contractor’s cost as the case may be.


6.9.5.5 The contractor or Developer will cause as little damage or interference to property or persons
as possible in disposing of water from the works, and will be responsible for any damage or
interference, which may be caused. This will include any damage to the structure of any road.


**6.9.6** **Metal Bedding**


6.9.6.1 Metal bedding will be in accordance with SD614 and SD615. This includes bedding, haunch
support and side support material as defined by NZS 2566 and AS/NZS 3725.


6.9.6.2 For concrete pipes, “Type H2” bedding in accordance with AS/NZS 3725 will be used.


6.9.6.3 The bedding material will be:


a) In a sand environment – Saturated sand;

**6.9.7** **Pipe Embedment**


6.9.7.1 The metal haunching and side support will be placed uniformly along and around the whole
length of the pipe barrel, couplings and other appurtenances in a manner to ensure uniform
density of side support (including haunch support) and overlay with no distortion, dislodgement
or damage to the pipeline.


6.9.7.2 Following placement, the embedment material will be compacted in layers to uniformly support
the pipe.


6.9.7.3 When choosing compaction equipment, the number of passes and the thickness of layer to be
compacted, the material to be compacted and the pipe to be installed will be taken into account.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 6 – Wastewater Page 20/30


6.9.7.4 Compaction equipment or methods that produce horizontal or vertical earth pressures that may
cause damage to, or excessive distortion of, the pipe will not be employed.


6.9.7.5 Metal haunching and side support will be compacted to the manufacturer’s requirements and as

haunching constructed of AP20 NZTA M4.


**6.9.8** **Installation of Geotextiles**


6.9.8.1 Where there is a possibility of migration of fines between the native soil and the pipe surround
soil, the DPA will require the metals to be protected by an approved geotextile filter fabric that
overlaps by at least 300mm. The extent of this “geotextile wrapping” must be shown on the Asbuilt plans.


**6.9.9** **Water-stops and Trench Groundwater**


6.9.9.1 A specific design is needed where permeable bedding is used. Water-stops and trench
drainage will be constructed to prevent unwanted movement of groundwater along the trench
and pipe bedding, see SD613. All captured stormwater must be reticulated to the stormwater
network, or at least an approved stormwater outlet.


6.9.9.2 Manholes will be considered to be water-stops provided they are constructed appropriately.


6.9.9.3 Where water stops are required, they must be provided at the intervals set out Table 6-6.


**Table 6-6 Water Stop Spacings**

|Grade|Spacing|
|---|---|
|1 in 15 or steeper|12m|
|1in 15|15m|
|1 in 25|30m|
|1 in 100|60m|



6.9.9.4 Where necessary and practicable, trench drainage as per SD613 will be required to prevent
groundwater infiltration at manhole connections.


**Note** : This will not be necessary where prefabricated plastic manholes such as the Smart PitTM are used
(see sections 6.7.2 and 6.11.2).


**6.9.10** **Pipe Installation**


6.9.10.1 To help with future identification the end caps and inside of the end of all new wastewater

laterals must be painted with red acrylic paint and marked with a 75mm x 25mm ground treated
marker stake suitably identified and partly painted red. (Note: stormwater laterals are to be
marked green).


6.9.10.2 A laser will be used by the contractor for fixing line and grade, for setting the pipes to line and

level, and for jointing on all major pipe-laying work where possible.


6.9.10.3 The maximum deviation in level of pipe invert when laid will be 5mm from design level. The line

must have a continual falling grade such that water cannot pond in any part of the pipeline.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 6 - Wastewater Page 21/30


6.9.10.4 The maximum horizontal deviation from a straight line will be 10mm.


6.9.10.5 Pipes will not be laid on bricks, blocks and wedges or other temporary or permanent supports

except when concrete surround is to be placed.


6.9.10.6 Joints will be flexible and watertight.


6.9.10.7 Pipes will be kept clear of dirt or debris, and any pipes that contain such matter will be required

to be cleaned out. Internal pipe walls will be kept clean and free of all dirt, rubbish and water.
Spigots, sockets, rubber rings, etc, will be thoroughly cleaned before jointing.


6.9.10.8 No glue joints will be permitted.


6.9.10.9 No new reticulation is to be connected to Council’s existing operational reticulation unless the

new reticulation has been checked and is free of all debris materials.

6.11.1.7 The channel through the manhole will be formed from in-situ concrete properly formed to grade

and radius sweeps. The channel will be finished with a smooth, regular half circle invert with
falls as specified in SD601 and SD603. Benching will be steel float finished to give a regular
smooth surface.


**6.11.2** **Installation of Thermoplastic Manholes**


6.11.2.1 In regard to thermoplastic manholes, installation will be to the supplier’s requirements subject to

the following conditions:


a) The ground is firm and stable;


b) The pipe size is small (ie. pipes up to and including diameter NB 225mm).


6.11.2.2 A manhole from thermoplastics will consist of a factory manufactured benched base, a vertical

riser(s), a suitable transition, as necessary, from the base to the riser (eg. an adaptor), a cover
slab, a throat, as necessary, from the cover slab to the lid at ground level, a frame and a cover.
The components must be easy to assemble on site to form a watertight construction.


6.11.2.3 Manholes from thermoplastics will have a safety factor of at least two against flotation after

backfilling (eg. weight of backfill over horizontal ring fins and cover slab).


6.11.2.4 All components of the manhole will be designed by the manufacturer for the expected site

loading including vehicle loads of 51kN (0. 85HN) where in trafficable areas. A manufacturer's
certificate will be provided to this effect.


6.11.2.5 Depth to the invert of the outlet from the lid will not exceed 3.0m.

**6.12.1** **Tape Location, Tape Type and Tape Installation**


6.12.1.1 The location of all pumping mains and gravity pressure mains (swallows) will be marked with a

foil tape buried in the trench.


6.12.1.2 The tape will be red, 50mm wide, and printed with “CAUTION PRESSURE SEWER MAIN

BURIED BELOW” or similar message. All printing will be encased to avoid any rub-off.


6.12.1.3 The tape will be either a woven reinforced acid and alkali resistant polythene plastic with a solid

aluminium foil core which will be visible from both sides.


6.12.1.4 The tape will be buried above the centre line of the pipe within 300mm to 400mm from the

finished surface, refer SD702.


6.12.1.5 All joints in the tape (eg. roll ends, accidental breaks and at tees) will be made electrically

conductive with purpose made splice clips installed to the specific manufacturer's instructions.
Tying together of the tape ends is not acceptable as the polythene coating will prevent electrical
conductivity.


6.12.1.6 The tape will be brought up inside the surface box risers at all manholes and air valves with a

300mm long tail so that pipe location equipment can be readily connected.


**6.12.2** **Tracer Wire**


6.12.2.1 When a pumping main or swallow pipe is installed by a directional drilling technique or bored

through the ground for a distance exceeding 20 metres a specific design for traceability is
required.


**6.12.3** **Testing**


6.12.3.1 The tracer tape or wire will be tested by the contractor for continuity using an electric pulse

induction system. The test must be witnessed and approved by Council. The new pipeline will
be tested between manholes, valves, etc where the tape is brought up inside the surface box
risers. The test will only be undertaken when all work associated with laying the wastewater
main is complete.


**6.13** **Valve painting**


Valves will be painted as shown on SD616.

**CHAPTER 7** **WATER**


**INTRODUCTION**


**7** **PURPOSE**


The Council seeks to create and manage a water supply network that will distribute water for consumption
and fire-fighting purposes, and which meets the appropriate standards and level of service for these uses,
delivered in an efficient, safe and sustainable way.


**7.1 Performance Outcomes**


Water supply performance outcomes for network assets sought by these standards are set out as follows.
They are subject to the objectives, policies and rules of the Nelson and Tasman RMPs:


a) Drinking water quality that ensures the health and safety of people and communities;


b) A water supply network that has adequate capacity, pressure, and points of connection to provide
water for all community needs including fire-fighting purposes;


c) A water supply network that minimises risk of contamination;


d) A water supply network that has sufficient capacity to accommodate reasonably foreseeable future
demand;


e) A network that is located in such a way as to adequately service each lot;


f) A network that is accessible for maintenance;


g) New supply infrastructure that will minimise adverse effects on, and be compatible with, the existing
water reticulation network, including existing equipment used by Council;


h) A water supply network that will minimise disruption to other parts of the network during maintenance
by having adequate interconnections, valves, and separating trunk main supplies from local
reticulation;


i) Is located, constructed and uses materials in a manner that minimises the potential for damage or
disruption due to natural hazards;


j) A network that is robust and durable, able to withstand, external pressures such as tree roots and
ingress of contaminants, as well as internal pressures such as water chemistry and pressure surges;
and


k) A network that is affordable over the whole-of-life of the system, including maintenance, operations
and replacement or renewal costs.


l) Water is sourced in a manner that protects the mauri of water and opportunities for Mahinga kai.


All performance outcomes are also subject to the applicable RMP objectives and policies and appropriate

**STANDARDS**


**7.3 Reticulation Design**


This section sets out Council’s expectation for the design of the layout, capacity, connection points, flow and
pressure of the water supply reticulation.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met in the design of the water supply reticulation:


**7.3.1** **General**


7.3.1.1 A water supply network will deliver quality water to the point of supply that complies with the
Drinking-water Standards for New Zealand 2005 (Revised 2008).


7.3.1.2 The water network will minimise the risks of contamination being introduced into the water.


**7.3.2** **Capacity and Layout**


7.3.2.1 The water supply network will have sufficient capacity to provide adequate flow and pressure to
meet the anticipated demand over its lifetime. Allowing for ultimate future development potential [1]
within the catchment or adjoining catchments.


7.3.2.2 The water supply network will meet the fire protection requirements of the NZ Fire Service Fire
Fighting Water Supplies Code of Practice 4509.


7.3.2.3 The water supply network will be located in such a way as to adequately service each lot and
provide reasonable access for maintenance. It will not be located on private land.


7.3.2.4 The design of the water supply network will:


a) Minimise adverse effects on, and be compatible with, the existing water reticulation network;


b) Minimise disruption to other parts of the network during maintenance by having adequate

interconnections, valves, and separating trunk main supplies from local reticulation;


c) Utilise mechanical, electrical, alarm and telemetry equipment which is compatible with

existing equipment used by Council;


d) Make provision for access and maintenance of any component where the expected life of that

component is less than that of the system of which it is a part;


e) Ensure that mechanical and electrical equipment is either designed for submergence or

located above the 100-year design flood level;


f) Minimise whole of life costs;


g) No water reticulation is to be constructed within private property or Council reserves;


h) Water reticulation must be located a minimum of 1.5 metres from any boundary line.


1 Development potential means the likely future development within the Services Overlay taking into account
the Council’s Strategic Development Plan and the LTP, and the provision of services in a manner that
integrates with and does not foreclose this likely future development.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 – Water Page 4/30


**7.3.3** **Structural Integrity**


7.3.3.1 The water supply network will be constructed of materials compatible with the chemical properties
of the water being conveyed, be suitable for the intended duty, have a minimum design life of
70 years and have a proven performance record.


7.3.3.2 The water supply facility will minimise leakage, eliminate the ingress of contaminants, and the
penetration of roots, using current best practice.


7.3.3.3 The water supply facility will provide electrical and mechanical equipment with a life span and
quality of the best currently available technology.


7.3.3.4 The facility will withstand all anticipated superimposed loads and network pressures (including
those from transient surges that could reasonably be expected from pump failure, pump starts, and
sudden valve closure).


**7.3.4** **Level of Service**


7.3.4.1 Table 7-2 sets out the minimum levels of service required for urban water supply reticulation. Any
proposed water supply system (or extension to an existing water supply system) will be adequate
to meet these levels of service at the time of design and the reasonably foreseeable future.


**Table 7-2 Water Supply Levels of Service**







|DesignCriteria|LevelofServiceRequired|
|---|---|
|SNZ PAS 4509: 2008 - NZ Fire Service Fire<br>Fighting Water Supplies Code of Practice|Full compliance with FW2 and every part of the network|
|Connection|Each lot will have an individual metered connection and<br>appropriate backflow for the site|
|Minimum flow at each connection|30 litresper minute for design flows(also refer to Table 7-3)|
|Minimum normal working residualpressure|300 kPa at thepoint of supply|
|Maximum static waterpressure|900 kPa at thepoint of supply|


**Note:** Any lots and buildings provided with private, on-site systems will meet the requirements of the

appropriate Resource Management Plan (RMP).


**7.3.5** **Design**


7.3.5.1 All proposed reticulated water supplies must comply with the minimum levels of service shown in
Table 7-2 for both normal demand flows and fire-fighting flows.


7.3.5.2 For residential development, network design and pipe sizes will be determined by fire-fighting
flows. As a minimum, the Designer must demonstrate compliance with fire-fighting code of
practice.


7.3.5.3 Principal mains will be not less than 150mm ID (see also, Table 7-5) and will be laid on one side of
all public roads in every residential development.


7.3.5.4 Rider mains will be not less than 50mm ID in residential development (see also Table 7-5) and will
be laid along the road frontage of all lots not fronted by a principal main and looped back to the
principal main to avoid dead ends. The principal mains serving commercial and industrial


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 - Water Page 5/30


developments will be at least 150mm ID on one side of the road with a 100mm ID main on the
other side.


7.3.5.5 The Council will have the right to specify the diameters to be used for the principal water mains
within the development with regard to the Council’s Strategic and Management Plans.


7.3.5.6 Regarding working pressure or pressures at the point or points of connection to the existing
reticulation, when such data is not available or at the Council’s request, it will be the responsibility
of the designing engineer to obtain the information through independent flow and pressure tests.


**7.3.6** **Permitted Head Losses**


7.3.6.1 The new water supply reticulation will be designed to mitigate large fluctuations in residual
pressure as demands vary and minimise the losses of pressure along the watermains. Head losses
in the watermains will not exceed approximately 20kPa/kilometre at peak domestic demand (i.e. 2
metres of head loss per 1000 metres of pipeline). Higher losses may be approved by the Council
on a case-by-case basis.


**7.3.7** **Reservoir Head**


7.3.7.1 For design purposes, the hydraulic head at a reservoir will be taken with the reservoir being 50%
full.


7.3.7.2 Water connections will be located so that properties at the highest location receive a pressure of
300kPa at the point of supply measured from the bottom operational water level of the reservoir
and properties at the lowest location receive a pressure not more than 900 kPa from the top
operational water level of the reservoir at the point of supply without the use of a PRV valve.


**7.3.8** **Normal Working Demand Flows**


7.3.8.1 When the source of supply is a pressure-reducing valve the hydraulic head will be the head the
pressure-reducing valve is set to.


7.3.8.2 The minimum flow and normal working residual pressure level of service criteria specified in Table
7-3 will be satisfied for all reticulation when using the following demand flows.


**Table 7-3 Design Demand Flows**

|DevelopmentType|DesignFlows|
|---|---|
|Residential|52 litres per person per peak hour<br>624 litres per person per day (peak day)<br>1560 litresper dwelling per day (assuming 2.5personsper dwelling)|
|Commercial and Industrial|Specifically assessed by the Designer|



**7.3.9** **Fire Fighting Demand Flows**


7.3.9.1 All reticulation (and storage) design must fully comply with the requirements of the NZ Fire Service
Fire Fighting Water Supplies Code of Practice (SNZ PAS 4509), hereafter called the Code of
Practice.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 – Water Page 6/30


7.3.9.2 For compliance in residential areas under classification FW2, a simultaneous flow of 12.5 l/s is
required from two fire hydrants with maximum hydrant spacing of 135.0m. Each hydrant is to be no
closer than 6.0m and no further than 135.0m from the potential fire source, refer Table 7-4.


**7.3.10 Alterations to Existing Infrastructure**


7.3.10.1 Regarding alterations to existing reticulation, any alteration (upgrading, relocation and lowering of

watermains and other water supply element(s), required for compliance of the new development to
the Council’s standards will be at the Developer’s cost. The connections to the existing reticulation
will be undertaken by a contractor approved by the Council, at the Developer’s cost.


7.3.10.2 No connection to Council’s reticulation will be permitted until all new reticulation has been

adequately flushed of all construction debris and sterilised.


**7.3.11 Depth of Water Mains**


7.3.11.1 The following standards apply to the installation of water mains:


a) Water mains will be installed to comply with SD701 to SD709 and AS/NZS 2566.2;


b) Both principal mains and rider mains will have the following cover, except in circumstances

requiring special protection. Greater depth will be provided if required by Council;


c) Under grass berms and footpaths in residential areas, the top of pipe for water mains is

600mm below the finished surface (minimum) and 900mm (maximum). In commercial and
rural areas, the top of pipe for water mains is 750mm (minimum) and 1000mm (maximum)
below the finished surface;


d) Under carriageways, the top of pipe is 750mm (minimum) and 1000mm (maximum) below

finished surface level, measured at the lowest point of the carriageway;


e) The sections of watermain adjacent to a driveway/vehicle crossing will be gradually

deepened, to allow the specified cover under the driveway/vehicle crossing without the
provision of vertical bends. Similar provision will be made to give the specified cover over
valve and hydrant spindles;


f) In berms, service connection pipes will have a minimum cover of 350mm and maximum cover
of 500mm. In the carriageway, right-of-way or accessway, service connection pipes will have
a minimum cover of 450mm and maximum cover of 750mm. At the meter box or rider main

valve, the pipe is permitted to have lesser cover where it is raised to suit the fitting height.


7.3.11.2 Council will not accept public water supply pipes located through private property within the urban


area.


7.3.11.3 Rural pipelines crossing private property may be permitted if no other reasonable routes are

available. All new pipework crossing private property must be protected with a three-metre-wide
easement-in-gross in favour of Council.


7.3.11.4 Building over or alongside a Public Watermain


a) Buildings over any water reticulation are not permitted;


b) Buildings alongside (within 1.5m) of any water reticulation will require a specific foundation

design to be submitted to the Engineering Manager for written approval.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 - Water Page 7/30


**7.3.12 Level of Service**


7.3.12.1 Council may require water mains or water supply facilities to be installed to a higher specification

(capacity or strength) to provide for future development.


7.3.12.2 The Council’s reticulation and asset plans should be carefully referred to when designing

extensions to, or amendments to the existing water supply reticulation.


7.3.12.3 Regarding supply requirements, Council, at its discretion may require demonstration of compliance

for normal demand, or to a nominated higher standard.


7.3.12.4 For commercial or industrial development, network design should be determined by normal

demand flows or fire-fighting flows and the Designer must demonstrate analysis of both scenarios.


7.3.12.5 The Council may provide details of the working pressure or pressures at the point or points of

connection to the existing reticulation that may be used for design purposes.


**7.3.13 Water Pressure and Storage Requirements**


7.3.13.1 Table 7-4 summarises the more general requirements of the Code of Practice for Normal

Reticulation Design. Further specific reference to the requirements Code of Practice may be
required for unusual situations.

**Note:** See the Fire-Fighting Code of Practice for additional notes and other specific requirements.


**7.4 Pipe Specifications**


This section sets out Council’s expectations for pipes, including general specifications, materials, sizes, joints
and seismic and liquefaction standards.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met in determining pipe design and materials choices:


**7.4.1** **Pipe Size**


7.4.1.1 Table 7-5 sets out the general pipe size, material, and pressure specifications for principal and
rider mains.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 – Water Page 8/30


**Table 7-5 General Pipe Specifications**











|Col1|PrincipalMains|RiderMains|

|**Pipe colour**|To suit purpose|To suit purpose|


**Notes:**


1) PVC and PE pressure pipes in New Zealand and Australia are usually referred to by their nominal

diameter or “DN”;


2) By Convention, PVC pipes, steel, and ductile iron pipes are referred to by their nominal INTERNAL

diameter (i.e. DN50, 100, 150 etc) and either Series 1 (metric sizes) or Series 2 (Imperial or CIOD sizes);


3) PE pipes are usually referred to and specified by their nominal OUTSIDE diameter (i.e. DN 63, 125,

180mm OD etc);


4) DN 63 = 50mm nominal internal diameter, DN 125 = 100mm nominal internal diameter, DN 180 =

150mm nominal internal diameter;


5) In any instance where an external diameter is shown on a drawing or specified it will be annotated “OD”.

Dimensions in absence of either “ID” or “OD” will be assumed by Council to refer to a nominal internal
diameter (“ID”);


6) Minimum and standard pipe sizes for principal and rider mains are shown in Table 7-5;


7) PVC pipes should generally be specified in metric (Series 1) sizes, but imperial (series 2) sizes may be

required in some instances for specific pipelines to achieve compatibility with Council’s existing pipe
system. Series 1 (metric) sizes or Series 2 (imperial) sizes are listed in the relevant PVC pipe
manufacturing standards.


**7.4.2** **Pipe Materials**


7.4.2.1 PVC-U or pipes are acceptable in all normal circumstances for principal mains.


7.4.2.2 PVC-M or PVC-O pipes may be approved on application. Installation will be to AS/NZS 2032 and
AS/NZS 2566 Part 2, with particular attention to the anchoring of valves and hydrants against
displacement in operation. Refer SD 703 and 704 and NZS 4404, Appendix A “Acceptable Pipe
Materials”.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 - Water Page 9/30


7.4.2.3 PE or PVC pipes will be used in all rider mains.


7.4.2.4 All PE pipes will be produced from PE compound complying with AS/NZS 4130 and PIPA
Technical Specifications POP 004 (polyethylene pipe and fittings compounds).


7.4.2.5 PE pipes will require specific approval by the Engineering Manager. For PE pipes PE80 PN12.5
material is the standard used. PE100 PN16 may be required in high pressure areas. For PE pipes
DN 125 and larger, PE 100 is the Standard used.


7.4.2.6 Pipes of differing compositions will not be mixed within a common pipe length, (i.e. valve-to-valve).
Installation of PE pipes will be to AS/NZS 2033 and AS/NZS 2566 Part 2.


7.4.2.7 Concrete lined steel pipes that are required in potentially unstable ground, for lengths of exposed
pipe, or in other special cases, will be the subject of specific design. Suitable corrosion protection
will be provided. Steel pipes laid underground will have an extruded blue or black HDPE external
coating. Pipe laid above ground will have a black HDPE coating or will have an approved epoxy
coating applied by a specialist applicator.


7.4.2.8 Ductile iron pipes will require specific approval of Council. Ductile iron pipes will be sleeved with a
polyethylene sleeve, conforming to AS 3681.


7.4.2.9 PE100 may be used where higher pipe strength or higher-pressure class is required or increased
capacity is an important criterion.


**7.4.3** **Pipe Joints**


7.4.3.1 Where a rider main is to be extended at right angles to a principal main, an elongated gibault will
be used (see SD705).


7.4.3.2 Where a rider main is to be extended along the same alignment beyond the end of the principal
main, it will normally be connected in accordance with SD706.


**7.4.4** **Unrestrained Mechanical Couplings**


7.4.4.1 Old style ‘Gibault’ joints have been superseded by new “universal” design bolted unrestrained
mechanical couplings, conforming to AS/NZS 4998, for all pipes except PE where only end load
restraint compression fittings, or heat fusion fittings, conforming to AS/NZS 4129, will be used.


7.4.4.2 Unrestrained Mechanical Couplings will be category 2 (50-year life) to AS/NZS 4998:2009.


**7.4.5** **PVC Pipe Joints**


7.4.5.1 Joints for PVC pipes will be integral thermoformed socket/spigot rubber ring type (Z joints or
locked-in-place Blueseal/Forsheda/Reiber style), with a biocidal lubricant. Elastomeric seal rings
will conform to AS 1646.


7.4.5.2 Unrestrained Mechanical Couplings (repair couplings) will only be used to close a section of pipe
where no other fittings are possible, or to adapt PVC pipe to existing in situ pipes, such as cast
iron, asbestos cement, steel or ductile iron, or to connect PVC pipe to a purpose made ductile iron
spigoted fitting.


7.4.5.3 Solvent cement joints on reticulation will not be permitted without the written approval of the
Engineering Manager.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 – Water Page 10/30


**7.4.6** **PE Pipe Joints**


7.4.6.1 All PE pipe less than or equal to DN63 (50mm OD) will be jointed by end load restraint mechanical
seal ring compression joints to AS/NZS 4129, appropriate for the type of pipe (e.g. “Plasson,
“Philmac”) and rated to PN16 maximum working pressure.


7.4.6.2 All PE pipes DN125 (100 mm ID) or larger will be joined by butt-fusion joints or electrofusion fittings
conforming to AS/NZS 4129.


7.4.6.3 Butt-fusion joints will comply with PIPA Technical Specification POP 003 (Butt Fusion Jointing of
PE Pipes and Fittings – Recommended Parameters).


7.4.6.4 Electrofusion joints will comply with POP 001 (Electrofusion Jointing of PE Pipes and Fittings for
Pressure Applications).


7.4.6.5 PE pipes will be installed in accordance with AS/NZS 2033 and AS/NZS 2566.


7.4.6.6 Certified tradespersons (as required in 7.4.6.8) approved by Council, will be employed with
semiautomatic or fully automatic welding equipment specifically designed for the task.


7.4.6.7 All butt welding or electrofusion welding equipment must be data log capable and all log
information must be made available to Council on request. The contractor will provide their own
power source and earth leakage protection for the safety of their personnel. No manual welding of
pipe joints will be accepted.


7.4.6.8 For electrofusion and butt welding, only personnel trained and holding a current certificate of
competency in the system to be used, will be permitted by Council to carry out the work. A copy of
the current certificate must be provided to Council before any welding proceeds.


7.4.6.9 The use of electrofusion joints on HDPE pipes is a specific task that requires special adherence to
quality materials and certified equipment, a clean and dry site and electrofusion jointing qualified
personnel. NZS 4130 generally outlines Polyethylene Pressure pipes criteria and the TEPPFA
Technical Guidance document - AGU/2014/01 (A good practice guide for the electrofusion jointing
of larger diameter polyethylene and pressure pipes).


**7.4.7** **Welded Steel Pipe Joints**


7.4.7.1 Welded joints in steel pipes will be either butt joints or full penetration butt weld with an external
welding band or bevelled. All welds will be fillet welds of 7mm or larger, applied in the field. All
welding is to be undertaken by certified personnel approved by Council. A copy of the current
certificate must be provided to Council before any welding proceeds.


7.4.7.2 Flange joints will be to AS 4087.


7.4.7.3 Where butt jointed pipes are used, the ends will be neatly butted where possible with a seal weld
applied from the outside before the welding band is affixed. Steel pipes will be cut to a neat and
true line with an abrasive saw.


7.4.7.4 After welding and testing (if required) all unprotected metal inside and outside will be thoroughly
cleaned by appropriate methods.


7.4.7.5 The exposed steel will be protected promptly, and damaged protective coating repaired in an
approved manner by the application of one of the treatments listed below:


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 - Water Page 11/30


a) Emer-tan rust converter; Emer-guard primer; Emer-clad membrane; or


b) Polyken Synergy™ which includes an appropriate primer coat; or


c) Carbomastic 15 primer; Servi-Wrap R15A membrane; Servi-Wrap Outerwrap.


7.4.7.6 Joints will be internally protected with a mortar lining to give a smooth internal bore. Materials for
the mortar will comply with the requirements of NZS 3121. It is important to get a satisfactory
mortar consistency to prevent the mortar from sagging or dropping out.


7.4.7.7 The pipe joint will be plugged with a suitable plunger prior to applying the mortar and then
withdrawn evenly to smooth out the mortar joint.


7.4.7.8 Epoxy mortar (suitable with potable water) will be used for making good the mortar lining where
pipes have been cut for mitred joints, or the fitting of flanges etc.


**7.4.8** **Seismic Design for Pipes**


7.4.8.1 All pipes and structure will be designed with adequate flexibility and special provisions to minimise
risk of damage during earthquakes.


7.4.8.2 Historical experience in New Zealand earthquake events suggests that suitable pipe options, in
seismically active areas, may include rubber ring joint PVC pipes, or PE pipes. Specially designed
flexible joints will be provided at all junctions between pipes and rigid structures (such as
reservoirs, pump stations, bridges, and buildings) in natural or made ground.


7.4.8.3 In areas prone to liquefaction or lateral spread, a geotechnical investigation will be required. The
geotechnical investigation will need to assess the potential of the ground to liquefy under seismic
loading and assess the likely effects of liquefaction on buried infrastructure. The assessment will
be conducted in accordance with NZGS guidance: Guideline for the identification, assessment and
mitigation of liquefaction hazards.


7.4.8.4 In areas where there is a potential for liquefaction or lateral spread to impact on buried
infrastructure, the network must be designed with special provisions to minimise the risk of damage
during an earthquake. Piped infrastructure is not generally designed for a particular seismic event
but rather for optimum resilience under seismic loading.


7.4.8.5 All PE pipes will be jointed using butt welding or electrofusion technique. Electrofusion fittings will
conform to AS/NZS 4129.


**7.4.9** **Watermains in Hydrocarbon Contaminated Ground**


7.4.9.1 PVC pipes with EPDM or nitrile seal rings or solvent cement joints may be used in hydrocarbon
contaminated ground.


7.4.9.2 PE pipes will not be used in ground that has been contaminated with hydrocarbons.


**7.5 Fittings**


This section sets out Council’s requirements for pipe fittings, hydrants and valves.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met in the choice and design of water supply fittings:


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 – Water Page 12/30


**7.5.1** **Pipe Fittings**


7.5.1.1 Ductile iron fittings such as tees, hydrant tees, crosses, tapers, hydrant risers, blank caps, plugs
and bends will conform to AS/NZS 2280, with thermo-bonded polymeric coating conforming to
AS/NZS 4158. Ductile iron sockets for Elastomeric seal joints, used with PVC pipes will be “deep
socket” type.


7.5.1.2 Tapping bands used on PVC pipes will be “full encirclement style” conforming to AS/NZS 4793.


7.5.1.3 Thermoformed PVC, elastomeric socket, long radius bends may be used with PVC pipes. and
short radius (elbow) bends will not be used. Solvent cement bends may only be permitted where
the necessary Z ring fitting is not manufactured.


7.5.1.4 On PE pipes DN 125 and larger, fittings will be end load resistant electrofusion or butt fusion style,
to AS/NZS 4129.


7.5.1.5 Flanges will be to Table 9 of AS/NZS 4331.2 and AS/NZS 4087. Fittings laid adjacent to other
fittings will have flanges.


7.5.1.6 All bolts, nuts and washers will be 316 stainless steel with molybond anti galling coating.


7.5.1.7 Graphite greases, packing and compounds will not be used in contact with stainless steel.


7.5.1.8 Where dissimilar metals are used, purpose-made delrin thermoplastic inserts will be installed in the
flanges to prevent electrolytic action.


7.5.1.9 Fittings which do not have bolts, nuts and washers which are 316 stainless steel and/or fittings
which are not thermos-bonded polymeric coated in accordance with AS/NZS 4158, will only be
used at the Engineering Manager’s discretion where no alternative product is available. In this case
these fittings will be wrapped as detailed in SD707 and SD708.


**7.5.2** **Corrosion Protection**


7.5.2.1 These standards apply to the protection of flange and unrestrained mechanical couplings.


7.5.2.2 Protection will normally be provided by the use of 316 stainless steel bolts, nuts and washers and
fittings coated to AS/NZS 4158. Fittings which do not have bolts, nuts, and washers that are 316
stainless steel and/or fittings which are not thermos-bonded polymeric coated will only be used with
approval of the Engineering Manager.


7.5.2.3 Where metallic pipes and fittings are not coated Delrin thermoplastic inserts will be installed in the
flange to prevent electrolytic action. Steel, grey cast iron and ductile iron flanges will be further
protected by a wrapping system.


7.5.2.4 Corrosion protection will be required (as follows) for all new flange and unrestrained mechanical
couplings, where materials other than 316 stainless steel and coatings to AS/NZS 4158 are used.


7.5.2.5 Flanges will comply with SD707.


7.5.2.6 Unrestrained Mechanical Couplings will comply with SD711 and AS/NZS 4998.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 - Water Page 13/30


**7.5.3** **Hydrants**


7.5.3.1 Fire hydrants will be installed on all principal mains in accordance with the requirements of the New
Zealand Fire Service Code of Practice.


7.5.3.2 Hydrants must be readily accessible for fire appliances and should generally be positioned near
road/street intersections in conjunction with valves.


7.5.3.3 A fire hydrant will be located at each road/street intersection and not be positioned closer than
6.0m from any dwelling.


7.5.3.4 In a cul-de-sac or other terminal streets, the last hydrant will be at the head of the cul-de-sac.


7.5.3.5 The distance between the hydrants and from the hydrants to the furthest building platform will not
exceed 135.0m.


7.5.3.6 Should a fire hydrant be required to be provided on private rights-of-way, Engineering Manager’s
approval will be required. Council will require either an Easement In Gross in favour of Council over
that line from the principal main to the hydrant or leave it as a private asset and have an isolation
valve at the boundary.


7.5.3.7 Hydrants will be to NZS 4522. Normally the short pattern will be used, except where Council may
approve or require the medium or tall pattern for extra flow capacity. Hydrants will not be selfdraining. Hydrants will be blue nylon coated inside and out and be clockwise closing.


7.5.3.8 In some high-risk commercial areas, hydrants will be installed in pairs to provide better water flows
(also refer Table 7-5).


7.5.3.9 Hydrant tees will be flanged if laid next to other fittings. Otherwise flexible Z ring joints are
permitted, refer SD703.


7.5.3.10 Hydrant risers will be used or the water main laid deeper where necessary, in order to ensure that

the top of the spindle is between 100mm and 200mm below finished surface level.


7.5.3.11 Hydrants will be installed so the spindle cap and riser connection are in line with the water main

below.


7.5.3.12 The manufacture and installation of hydrant boxes will be to NZS 4522. Hydrant boxes will be

aligned in the direction of the water main. Heavy pattern hydrant boxes will be used. All hydrant
boxes (cover and frame) will meet Class D strength to AS 3996. Covers must be ‘anti-rocking’.


7.5.3.13 Hydrants will be marked in accordance with SNZ PAS 4509 Appendix G. Hydrants will be marked

in accordance with NZS 4501 with raised blue reflectorised markers together with painted triangle
and painted fire hydrant box as shown on SD709.


7.5.3.14 Hydrant boxes will be set on approved pre-cast concrete sections.


7.5.3.15 The top of any surface box will be flush with the finished surface level in sealed carriageway and

grassed surfaces. For areas to be planted, the top of the surface box will be between 40mm and
60mm above the finished surface level and no closer than 1.5m to trees or shrubs.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 – Water Page 14/30


**7.5.4** **Positioning of Valves**


7.5.4.1 Valves will generally be placed on all the three legs of a tee intersection to optimise control of the
water supply system and minimise the number of customers without water in case of a shut-down.


7.5.4.2 Sluice valves will be flanged and bolted to each leg of the “tee” to form a single assembly. A
hydrant will be included between the valves.


7.5.4.3 Line valves will be installed where the distance between other line valves exceeds 250m. For water

mains over 200mm diameter, line valves will be required at least every 450m and will be positioned
as agreed by Council. Rider mains will have valves at both ends, located as close to the principal
main as practical, but within the berm or footpath.


**7.5.5** **Depth of Valves**


7.5.5.1 The top of sluice valve spindles will be 200-300mm below ground level, refer SD704.


7.5.5.2 The top of the hand wheel on any resilient seated valve will be 150 to 225mm below ground level.


**7.5.6** **Sluice Valves**


7.5.6.1 Sluice valves on all water reticulation will comply with NZS/AS 2638.2, Class PN16 (a class higher
than 16 may be required in certain circumstances).


7.5.6.2 Valves will be resilient, seated, and anti-clockwise closing with a stem sealed by “o” rings capable
of being replaced under pressure. They will have external and internal polymeric coating to
AS/NZS 4158.


7.5.6.3 Specific design, subject to the approval of Council, will be required for valves over 250mm NB.


7.5.6.4 The valve will be capable of bi-directional flow of water. Valves will be set so that the spindle is
truly vertical.


7.5.6.5 Sluice valves will be installed in accordance with SD704 and will be marked as per SD709.


7.5.6.6 Approval of any particular sluice or gate valve will be entirely at the discretion of the Engineering
Manager.


**7.5.7** **Rider Main Valves**


7.5.7.1 Valves on rider mains of 50mm internal diameter will be an approved resilient-seated sluice valve
with socket ends. Where a valve is to be connected directly to a Tee, or similar flanged item, a
valve with one flanged and one socket end is to be used.


7.5.7.2 Valves on other than PE rider mains of 50mm internal diameter will have connections suitable for

the material used – socket/thread or flange as appropriate.


**7.5.8** **Air Release Valves**


7.5.8.1 Water mains will be laid to grade such that, for the purpose of the release of the air, a fire hydrant,
an automatic air valve or a 20mm diameter ferrule and gate valve in a permanent surface box will
be installed at high points or in locations required by Council. They will be installed so that ground
water cannot enter the main at negative main pressure.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 - Water Page 15/30


7.5.8.2 Automatic air valves >25mm, will be approved testable ‘, single or double, large or small orifice,
and of appropriate nominal bore. Automatic air valves will be flanged and be mounted on flanged
risers with an integral isolating valve accessible from ground level. Air valves that need to be
installed below ground will be installed within a standard manhole (marked ‘AV) with positive
drainage to an outlet such that ground water cannot enter the main at negative mains pressure.


7.5.8.3 Automatic air valves should be installed above ground in all situations unless approved by the
Engineering Manager.


**7.5.9** **Scour Valves**


7.5.9.1 Scour valves will be either a fire hydrant or an approved resilient seated valve as for air release
above and will be installed at low points or to facilitate draining of a water main where required by
Council.


7.5.9.2 All dead-end mains or rider mains will be fitted with permanent scour valves complete with valve
box.


7.5.9.3 In areas where the scouring of mains is needed as a frequent operation, a connection to an
approved discharge point will be provided. The connection of a scour valve to stormwater pipes or
manholes is not permitted.


7.5.9.4 The box will be similar to a fire hydrant box but will be marked “SV” rather than “FH”.


**7.5.10 Butterfly Valves**


7.5.10.1 Butterfly valves will only be used with the specific approval of the Engineering Manager.


7.5.10.2 Butterfly valves will be located in concrete valve chambers.


**7.5.11 Non-Testable Non-Return Valves**


7.5.11.1 Swing check valves will comply with the relevant standards and AS 4794-2001.


7.5.11.2 Non-return valves will be capable of being serviced without removal from the main. Cast iron swing

check valves will be fusion bonded thermoplastic coated or epoxy coated. All coatings will be
compatible with potable water and will be coloured blue.


7.5.11.3 Below ground swing check valves will be within a standard manhole.


**7.5.12 Valve Boxes**


7.5.12.1 All valves will be fitted with an approved square pattern cast iron surface box with the lid marked

“SV” or “V” and a 150mm lid on a PVC riser pipe. Heavy duty lids will be used.


7.5.12.2 The riser pipe will extend from the valve bonnet to 80mm below the finished surface and be placed

vertically over the valve. The valve box will be supported on a firm foundation so that no direct
loading is transmitted from the box to the main or riser, see SD703


7.5.12.3 If the distance between the finished surface level and the top of the valve spindle is greater than

300mm, a valve key extension will be fitted.


7.5.12.4 Valve boxes will be painted as shown in SD709.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 – Water Page 16/30


**7.5.13 Restraint blocks**


7.5.13.1 Cast in-situ concrete restraint blocks will be provided on mains 50mm ID or greater, at all points

where an unbalanced thrust occurs. This will include all bends, tapers, valves, pressure reducing
valves, tees and blank ends.


7.5.13.2 For butt welded and electrofused PE pipework up to 150mm ID, restraint blocks may not be

required. Where PE pipes connect to other pipework or fittings with flexible joints, restraint blocks
are required.


7.5.13.3 The design of restraint blocks will be based on “good ground” soil bearing capacity (as defined in

NZS3604) or the ultimate bearing capacity of the site soils, whichever is lesser. A safety factor of
between 1.5 and 2 will be used in the design. Restraint block bearing area calculations will be
submitted with the engineering plans for checking and approval.


7.5.13.4 The inner face of the block will not be of a lesser thickness than the diameter of the fittings and will

be so constructed as not to impair access to the bolts on the fittings. Concrete will have a minimum
compressive strength of 25mPa at 28 days.


7.5.13.5 All restraint blocks will be cast in-situ concrete. Pre-cast concrete blocks may be permitted with the

Engineering Manager approval.


7.5.13.6 A protective membrane of not less than three layers of 250 micron polythene sheet or similar will

be provided between the pipe (irrespective of the pipe material) and the concrete block to prevent
abrasive damage to the water main.


7.5.13.7 Valves and hydrants on PVC pipe lines require anchorage to resist torque when the valve is

operated.


7.5.13.8 Valves will be anchored as shown on SD704. A fish-tailed galvanised flat steel bar will be attached

to the bottom bolt on each flange of the valve and incorporated into a cast in-situ concrete pad
200mm deep, of the same width as the trench and extending 150mm beyond each anchor bar.
Care will be taken to ensure that all bolts can be removed for future maintenance and are not

obstructed by concrete.


7.5.13.9 Hydrant tees, when flanged, will be anchored as valves, refer SD704. Hydrant tees with rubber ring

joints will be anchored by bedding the tee in a concrete pad 200mm deep, of the same width as the
trench and not extending beyond the length of the tee. Care will be taken to ensure that the flexible
joints are not encased.


**7.5.14 Thrust Block design**


7.5.14.1 In designing water main restraint blocks, the following formula will be used:


Bends:


Thrust Force R = 15.4 Hd [2] sin (θ/2)


R = thrust in kN


Where H = head of water in metres, i.e. 180m max


d = diameter of pipe in metres


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 - Water Page 17/30


|θ=angleof<br>deflectionPipe<br>dia-d|θ -11 .25º bend|θ -22 .5º bend|θ -45ºbend|θ -90ºbend|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|100|2.77|5.51|10.81|19.98|
|150|6.23|12.40|24.33|44.96|
|200|11.08|22.05|43.26|79.93|


R – thrust in kN for each diameter and bend.

Tee or Closed End:


Thrust Force R = 7.7 Hd [2]


R = thrust in kN


Where H = head of water in metres, i.e. 180m max


d = diameter of pipe in mm

Reducers:


Thrust Force R = 7.7 (d, [2] – d [2 2] )


R = thrust in kN


Where H = head of water in metres, i.e. 180m max


d1 and d2 are the two pipe internal diameters in mm. The magnitude of this thrust can be obtained
by taking the difference of the two thrusts for closed ends of the two relevant diameters.

2) Table 7-6 is a guide only;


3) Soil parameters are classed as “good ground” in accordance with NZS 3604;


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 – Water Page 18/30


4) Test head 150m and factor of safety of two (2) for all applications.


**7.6 Water Supply Connections**


This section prescribes standards for the provision of supply connections.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met in the provision of supply connections


**7.6.1** **Point of supply to customer**


7.6.1.1 The point of supply to each customer will be determined in accordance with the Council’s Water
Supply Bylaw. Each individual dwelling or unit will have a single point of water supply and a meter.
Premises of multiple ownership including body corporate, strata title and leasehold/tenancy in
common scheme will be supplied and metered in accordance with the Council’s Water Supply
Bylaw.


7.6.1.2 Individual lots will have individual meters located at the street boundary. From the meter an
individual water connection will be installed to the body of each individual lot.


7.6.1.3 In all situations the meter box is to be located a minimum of 0.5 m clear of the driveway entrance
and not located within the driveway.


**7.6.2** **Service Connection Diameter**


7.6.2.1 The standard connection sizes must be 20mm ID, 25mm ID, 40mm ID, 50mm ID, 100mm ID and
150mm ID. Any connection larger than this will need to be approved by the Engineering Manager.


7.6.2.2 The minimum size will be 20mm internal diameter to urban connections.


7.6.2.3 The minimum size connection to a commercial/industrial lot is 50mm internal diameter.


**7.6.3** **Individual Connections**


7.6.3.1 An individual connection will be required for each lot via its own legal street frontage with the meter
assembly located at the street boundary. For clarification - back sections served by rights of way
need to have their own individual water meter located at the street frontage. Individual water
connections (owner and maintained by the individual land owners) are to be provided from the
meter to the rear lots.


7.6.3.2 Where tapping bands and service connections are to be omitted in commercial and industrial
subdivisions (with the approval of the Engineering Manager), a covenant will be placed on the title
outlining that the lot owner is responsible for all costs associated with the installation of the service
connection (all costs include development contributions physical installation and related fees).


7.6.3.3 All service connections will be laid at right angles to the frontage. The supply line between the
ferrule and the meter box is to be laid as a single length of pipe with no joins or tight bends along
its length.


**7.6.4** **Tapping Bands and Ferrules**


7.6.4.1 Tapping bands for PVC pipes will comply with AS/NZS4793.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 - Water Page 19/30


7.6.4.2 Tapping bands for PE pipes will be specifically designed for use with PE pipe and comply with
AS/NZS 4129. Bronze mechanical tapping saddles will not be used on PE pipes.


7.6.4.3 Where the horizontal distance between the ferrule and the meter manifold is less than 1.0m, the
assembly will be subject to specific design approval by the Engineering Manager and will be laid to
avoid any pipe stresses.


7.6.4.4 In all situations, lateral connections and ferrules will be located a minimum of 0.5m clear of
driveway entrances.


7.6.4.5 Each service connection to a main or a rider main will be by means of a tapping band and a
"Talbot" Bronze push-fit swivel ferrule with the flow of water controlled by a screwed brass plug.


7.6.4.6 Tapping bands on PVC pipes will be of an approved type complying with AS/NZS 4793, fully
encircling the pipe to prevent over tightening and distortion of the pipe.


7.6.4.7 Tappings on ISO dimension PE80 - pipes will be by means of a vertical compression tee (with BSP
female branch) and ferrule. Tapping saddles will not be used on PE pipe without approval by the
Engineering Manager.


7.6.4.8 If the required service is larger than is possible to connect with a tapping band the main connection
will be by a tee or a tapped elongated joint having a vertically connected ferrule. For connections,
larger than 50mm ID, the connection will be by means of an elongated gibault tee and sluice valve
at the approval of the Engineering Manager.


7.6.4.9 Tapping bands and ferrules on the water mains will be fitted when the mains are first laid (except
as provided for in Section 7.6.4).


**7.6.5** **Meter Assembly for 20mm and 25mm ID Connection**


7.6.5.1 The service connection will terminate adjacent to the street boundary with an approved 20/25mm
nominal bore water meter assembly and box approved by the Engineering Manager. All meter
assemblies must consist of a manifold, isolating valve and double check valve housed in an
“Everhard”, Acuflow AMBT285, or “Draper” DRA 20/1 underground meter box. Metal meter boxes
are to be used for commercial and industrial accessways and in residential areas that will be traffic
loaded and with the approval of the Engineering Manager.


7.6.5.2 The meter box will be no closer than 150mm or more than 300mm away from the street boundary
on the street side of the boundary, clear of regular vehicle traffic movement.


7.6.5.3 The pipework at the meter box will have an earth cover of 260mm to 300mm depth over it. Refer
SD706 and finished flush with the surrounding ground.


7.6.5.4 The meter box will be placed on a firm base so that it will not be depressed below the finished
surface by settlement or occasional vehicular traffic.


**7.6.6** **Meter Assembly for 32 - 40mm ID Connection**


7.6.6.1 For 32 – 40mm ID services a meter assembly consisting of an approved resilient seated valve with
stainless steel bolts will be used. The meter will be approved by the Engineering Manager. An
approved backflow preventer will be used with the meter and housed in an approved meter box or
above ground if testable.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 – Water Page 20/30


**7.6.7** **Meter assembly for 50mm ID and larger Connection**


7.6.7.1 All service connections including dedicated fire sprinkler or fire-fighting mains will be required to be
metered.


7.6.7.2 The meter will be a compound meter and will be approved by the Engineering Manager and will be
installed at the boundary to the manufacturer’s specification and housed along with approved
isolating valve and backflow preventer in a meter box of size and construction approved by the
Council. If a reduced pressure zone backflow preventer is used, this will be mounted above ground
level. Meters other than compound meters require specific approval for installation at new sites.


**7.6.8** **Water Meters**


7.6.8.1 At the completion of works and prior to issue of the 224 certificate for developments, the Developer
must supply a completed water meter location form (see Appendix A) to the Engineering Manager
for approval. Water meters will be fitted to all connections in accordance with Table 7-7.

- = for compound meters; high flow meters Class B, low flow meters Class C;

**Note:**



1) Meters with higher “R” numbers are acceptable. Compound meters are designated by the characteristic

of the larger meter only;


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 - Water Page 21/30


2) Meter connections larger than 25 mm diameter will be subject to the approval of the Council. The

applicant may be required to present hydraulic calculations supporting the choice of meter size to the
Council for approval.


**7.6.9** **Backflow Preventers**


7.6.9.1 All new industrial and commercial properties will have a backflow preventer installed after the
meter as close as practical to the point of supply. The type and location of backflow preventers will
comply with the Building Act, the Health Act 1956 as amended by the Health (Drinking Water)
Amendment Act, AS/NZS 2845.1 and the Council’s Water Supply Bylaw.


**7.6.10 Reuse of Existing Service Connections**


7.6.10.1 A proposal to reuse an existing service will only be approved if the service is of adequate size; and,

it can be established that the service is less than 15 years old; or, the service is to continue
supplying the same building that it was originally intended for, and no others.


7.6.10.2 This policy applies only to the Council portion of the water service i.e. from the main up to the point

of supply.


**7.6.11 Disconnections**


7.6.11.1 Redundant services will be disconnected from the water main by Council’s approved contractor.


7.6.11.2 The service fitting will be removed or plugged at the connection to the water main.


7.6.11.3 All costs associated with the disconnection will be recovered by Council from the landowner

requiring the disconnection.

requirements of the NZ Building Code (a Building Consent will be required) and the connection to
the Council system is via a water meter and backflow protection to a suitable sized water tank
located on the private land. There is to be no direct pumping from a water connection.


**7.8 Construction and Installation**


This section sets out Council’s expectations for the installation and construction of the water supply network.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met in the construction and installation of water supply

reticulation:


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 - Water Page 25/30


**7.8.1** **Trench Width**


7.8.1.1 The minimum trench width will be 200mm wider either side than the external diameter of the collar

of the pipe being laid.


7.8.1.2 The trench will be of sufficient width to permit with freedom the installation of all trench support and
to allow the laying and jointing of pipes and placing of bedding and pipe surround materials.


**7.8.2** **Base of Excavation**


7.8.2.1 No construction or work above the excavation base will commence until the base of the excavation

has been inspected and accepted by the DPA. The trench base is to be checked for stability of the
soil by the DPA.


7.8.2.2 The Contractor will provide trench support to comply with the requirements of Work Safe New
Zealand.


**7.8.3** **Trench Support**


7.8.3.1 The Contractor will ensure that the sides of the trench are sufficiently supported so that cracking of
the surrounding ground does not occur.


**7.8.4** **Trench Foundation Stability**


7.8.4.1 Where there are issues concerning foundation compaction and stability, the DPA will order the use
of additional granular bedding material as specified in AS/NZS 3725 for concrete pipes, or AS/NZS
2566.2 for PVC and other flexible pipe systems.


**7.8.5** **Dewatering**


7.8.5.1 Excavations will be kept free of water during construction.


7.8.5.2 In no circumstances will stormwater or ground water be allowed to drain into any existing
wastewater drain.


7.8.5.3 Discharge of stormwater or groundwater to existing stormwater drains will be permitted providing
adequate silt traps prevent debris and suspended matter from entering drains. Should deposits in
existing stormwater drains or the pipes already laid occur as a result of the operations of the
Developer or the Contractor such deposits will be cleared forthwith at the Developer’s or the
Contractor’s cost as the case may be.


7.8.5.4 The Contractor or Developer will cause as little damage or interference to property or persons as
possible in disposing of water from the works, and will be responsible for any damage or
interference, which may be caused. This will include any damage to the structure of any road.


**7.8.6** **Metal Bedding**


7.8.6.1 The standards apply in respect of bedding, haunch support and side support material as defined by
NZS 2566.2: and AS/NZS 3725.


7.8.6.2 Metal bedding will be in accordance with SD614 and SD615.


7.8.6.3 The bedding material will be:


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 – Water Page 26/30


a) In a sand environment – use compacted saturated sand;


b) For PVC and flexible pipes - AP20 NZTA M4 or as per AS/NZS 2566.2;


c) Bedding compaction will be undertaken in accordance with AS/NZS 3725 for type H2 support;


d) The pipes will be laid and brought to true alignment and level before installing the metal

haunching, side support and covering the pipes.


**7.8.7** **Pipe Embedment**


7.8.7.1 The metal haunching and side support will be placed uniformly along and around the whole length
of the pipe barrel, couplings and other appurtenances in a manner to ensure uniform density of
side support (including haunch support) and overlay with no distortion, dislodgement or damage to
the pipeline.


7.8.7.2 Following placement, the embedment material will be compacted in layers to uniformly support the
pipe. When choosing compaction equipment, the number of passes and the thickness of layer to
be compacted, account will be taken of the material to be compacted and the pipe to be installed.


7.8.7.3 Compaction equipment or methods that produce horizontal or vertical earth pressures that may
cause damage to, or excessive distortion of, the pipe will not be employed.


7.8.7.4 Metal haunching and side support will be compacted to the manufacturer’s requirements and as a
guide, a minimum Clegg Impact Value of 35 under vehicle loaded areas or 25 under non-traffic
loaded areas will be achieved at any point on any haunching constructed of AP20.


**7.8.8** **Geotextiles**


7.8.8.1 Where there is a possibility of migration of fines between the native soil and the pipe surround soil,
the DPA will require the metals to be protected by an approved geotextile filter fabric that overlaps
by at least 300mm. The extent of this “geotextile wrapping” must be shown on the as-built plans.


**7.8.9** **Concrete Protection**


7.8.9.1 Where cover over pipes is less than the minimum as required by the pipe manufacturer and the
relevant New Zealand standards, including temporarily under construction traffic, a concrete
protection slab will be constructed. The written approval of the Engineering Manager is required for
all concrete protection.


**7.8.10 Water Stops and Trench Groundwater**


7.8.10.1 A specific design is needed where permeable bedding is used. Water-stops and trench drainage

will be constructed to prevent unwanted movement of groundwater along the trench and pipe
bedding, see SD613 (Chapter 6). All captured stormwater must be reticulated to the stormwater
network, or at least an approved stormwater outlet.


7.8.10.2 Manholes will be considered to be water-stops provided they are constructed appropriately.


7.8.10.3 Where water stops are required, they must be provided at the intervals set out in


7.8.10.4 Table 7-8.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 - Water Page 27/30


**Table 7-8 Water Stops Spacing and Gradient**

|Grade|Spacing|
|---|---|
|1 in 15 or steeper|12m|
|1 in 15|15m|
|1 in 25|30m|
|1 in 100|60m|



**Note:** Intermediate grades (and spacing) are determined by interpolation.


**7.8.11 Pipe Installation**


7.8.11.1 In respect of pipe installation, Pipes will not be laid on bricks, blocks and wedges or other

temporary or permanent supports.


7.8.11.2 Pipes will be kept clear of dirt or debris, and any pipes that contain such matter will be required to

be cleaned out. Internal pipe walls will be kept clean and free of all dirt, rubbish and water. Spigots,
sockets, rubber rings, fittings etc, will be thoroughly cleaned before jointing.


**7.9 Trenchless Technology**


This section relates to the use of trenchless technology for the installation of water reticulation.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met in the use of trenchless technology for the installation of

water reticulation:


**7.9.1** **General**


7.9.1.1 Trenchless technology will only be used in specific circumstances where approved by the
Engineering Manager.


7.9.1.2 Pipes used for trenchless installation will have suitable mechanically restrained joints, specifically
designed for trenchless application, which may include integral restraint, seal systems, or heat
fusion welded joints.


7.9.1.3 Any trenchless technology and installation methodology will be chosen to be compatible with
achieving the required gravity pipe gradient – refer to the manufacturer’s and installer’s
recommendations.


7.9.1.4 The following details including location of access pits and exit points will be submitted to the
Engineering Manager for approval:


a) Clearances from services and obstructions; the depth at which the pipeline is to be laid to

ensure minimum cover is maintained;


a) The pipe support and ground compaction;


b) How pipes will be protected from damage during construction;


c) Any assessed risk to abutting surface and underground structures; and


d) A clear methodology of how to deal with unknown obstructions and services.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 – Water Page 28/30


7.9.1.5 Gouging or notching of the pipe will not exceed 10% of the pipe wall thickness for pressure pipe
and 20% of the pipe wall thickness for gravity pipe. Pipe will not be bent to a radius less than 35
times the pipe OD for PE pipes or 600 times the pipe OD for PVC pipes.


7.9.1.6 The specified allowable load on the pipe will not be exceeded during pulling.


7.9.1.7 Where gouging or notching exceeds the above limits or if buckling of the pipe occurs, that length of
pipe will be removed, and a new section welded in at the nearest join.


7.9.1.8 The contractor will over tow the pipe by one lineal metre for each length of pulled pipe that is the
greater of one manhole length or 200m. The excess pipe length will be supplied to the DPA for a
visual inspection.


**7.9.2** **Tracer Tape**


7.9.2.1 For water work a tracer tape system must be incorporated into the trenchless work. The tracer tape
must comply with section 7.9.4.


7.9.2.2 The location of all water mains will be marked with a foil tape buried in the trench.


7.9.2.3 The tape will be blue, 50mm wide, and printed with “CAUTION WATER MAIN BURIED BELOW” or
similar message. All printing will be encased to avoid rub-off.


7.9.2.4 The tape will be either a woven reinforced acid and alkali resistant polythene plastic with a solid
aluminium foil core which will be visible from both sides.


**7.9.3** **Tracer Tape Installation**


7.9.3.1 The tape will be buried above the centre line of the pipe within 300mm to 400mm from the finished
surface, refer SD702.


7.9.3.2 All joints in the tape (e.g. roll ends, accidental breaks and at tees) will be made electrically
conductive with purpose made splice clips installed to the specific manufacturer’s instructions.
Tying together of the tape ends is not acceptable as the polythene coating will prevent electrical
conductivity.


7.9.3.3 The tape will be brought up inside the surface box risers at all valves and hydrants with a 300mm
long tail so that pipe location equipment can be readily connected.


**7.9.4** **Tracer Wire**


7.9.4.1 When a pumping main or swallow pipe is installed by a directional drilling technique or bored
through the ground for a distance exceeding 20 metres a specific design for traceability is required.


**7.9.5** **Tape or Wire Testing**


7.9.5.1 The tracer tape will be tested by the Contractor for continuity using an electric pulse induction
system. The test must be witnessed and approved by Council.


7.9.5.2 The new watermain/rider main will be tested between any new valves, hydrants etc where the tape
is brought up inside the surface box risers. This test will only be undertaken when all work
associated with laying the watermain/rider main is complete.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 - Water Page 29/30


**7.9.6** **Testing, Disinfection and Connection**


7.9.6.1 All water supply pipelines to be vested in Council ownership and/or connected to the Council
network will pass the hydrostatic pressure test in NZS 4404 Appendix C3 ‘Pressure pipelines –
Field hydrostatic pressure testing’. All final test results sheets are to be included in the package of
as-built information provided to Council.


7.9.6.2 All new reticulation will be flushed and disinfected to the requirements of NZS 4404, Appendix D –
‘Water Supply Disinfection Specification’.


7.9.6.3 Connection to existing water main will not be made until all new work (excluding the connection)
has been completed and inspected and approved by Council. Specifically, this will include testing,
disinfection and flushing of all new pipework, and fittings by the Contractor.


7.9.6.4 The developer is to consult with Council as to the requirements of the flushing and disinfection of
all new water reticulation. Disinfection of the new water reticulation needs to ensure that there is no

_E. coli_ and acceptable levels of coliforms in the sourced water. Testing will be on a case by case
basis depending on the pipe network size and length of pipe. Council will carry out the final testing
etc to determine if the required disinfection has been carried out.


**Note:**


If _E. coli_ re-testing is required by the Council, the costs may be on-charged to the Developer.

**Appendix B** **Rural Water Supply – Tasman District Council only**


Council operates low-flow rural water supplies outside urban centres over large sections of the Waimea and
Moutere areas. Many of the pipelines (laid with the permission of the “then” owner) serving these schemes
are not protected by easements but cross large tracts of private land. Connection to some of the schemes
are limited by pipeline capacity, water permits conditions and by allocation limits established in the TRMP.

**B.1** **Connection to Existing Rural Water Supplies**


B.1.1 When contemplating subdivisions or development in rural areas, Designers should first ascertain the
existence of a water supply reticulation system in the area. Should one exist, the Developer or
subdivider will require confirmation from Council that capacity for connection is available if required.


B.1.2 Designers will need to:


i) Consult the New Zealand Fire Service for cluster developments, to satisfy SNZ PAS 4509.


ii) Demonstrate that capacity is available for proposed and foreseeable future flows, and


iii) Verify that an easement for a pipeline can be secured.


B.1.3 Written confirmation of the above will be attached to the subdivision consent application.


**B.2** **Relocation of Rural Supply Pipelines**


B.2.1 Where any development requires relocation of rural water supply pipelines the cost of relocation and
the easement will be a charge against the Developer. All relocated pipework located within private
property will need to be protected by way of an easement in favour of Council (Note 7.3.11.3). No
relocation of a water supply can take place without the approval of Council.


**B.3** **New Rural Supply**


B.3.1 If no public rural water reticulation schemes are available for connection, the consent holder will
prove that at least 1.0m [3] of potable water per day per lot is available to serve the subdivision.
Easements may be required to the water source to secure the supply. (Due to the lack of consistent
rainfall in the Tasman area, roof water supply alone cannot be relied upon to service the
subdivision). Also an approved water take may be required as set out in the TRMP.


**B.4** **Rural Connections**


B.4.1 Each lot will be serviced by a minimum 20mm diameter service pipe with a restrictor valve as
approved by Council to limit supply.


B.4.2 Where water is available, reticulation will be installed and the consent holder will pay the applicable
fee for joining and connection of each lot. Joining fees for each scheme together with charges are
set out in Council’s LTP.


B.4.3 Storage of water on a rural water scheme must comply with Council’s Water Supply Bylaw.


**B.5** **As-Built Drawings**


B.5.1 The developers will, whether or not connections are made to the rural scheme, provide as-built plans
of the position of rural water supply pipelines relative to the boundaries within the development.


**B.6** **Rural Fire Fighting Supply**


B.6.1 For any dwelling that is not connected to a reticulated water supply incorporating water mains fitted
with fire hydrants, with the closest hydrant no more than 135m from the dwelling, it is a requirement
of the TRMP (refer Chapter 17) that each dwelling will have either a home fire-sprinkler system that
is fitted with a reliable year-round water supply OR;


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 7 - Water Appendix B - Page 1/2


B.6.2 The dwelling will have access to a water supply of at least 45,000 litres provided in an approved
location solely for fire-fighting purposes. The water must be accessible to fire-fighting equipment.
Any water storage must be full at all times.


B.6.3 The fire-fighting water supply can be from a number of sources; dams, water tanks, pools and lakes,
streams and rivers, sea water.


B.6.4 A fire appliance should be able to sit on a hard-standing area and be no more than 6.0m from the
water source (or water supply connection). The water source should be no more than 3.0m below,
and no more than 10.0m above the appliance pump inlet.


B.6.5 A fire service coupling will be required to enable access to the water supply. Appropriate all-weather
access for a two-axle truck should be provided to the supply site.


In cluster housing developments in rural supply areas fire-fighting water supplies may be combined.
This may include a group of linked tanks above house levels and sited to mitigate visual impact on
the landscape (as an alternative to individual tanks on each property). These tanks may be fed from
the rural restrictor supply and/or from roof supply and pumps. Easements or consent notices may be
required to protect these reservoirs and lines for the lots they serve. These will be provided with
access, reticulation (a minimum 100mm diameter main), fittings for fire-fighting purposes and a hardstanding area reserved for fire appliances. The fire service couplings will be no further than 90.0m
from, and no closer than 6.0m to the dwelling.


B.6.6 Further advice and information about managing fire risk and storage of water for fire-fighting,
including information about appropriate fittings for connection with fire appliances, can be obtained
from the New Zealand Fire Service.

**CHAPTER 8** **EARTHWORKS, TRENCHING AND REINSTATEMENT**
**MANAGEMENT**


**INTRODUCTION**


**8** **PURPOSE**


The purpose of this section is to clearly outline Council’s requirements for excavation, backfilling and
reinstatement work, and sub-soil drains, within the road reserve and public property.


**8.1 Performance Outcomes**


Earthworks, trenching, reinstatement and sub-soil drains performance outcomes for network assets sought
by these standards are as follows:


a) The health and safety of the public, particularly the local community, has been ensured;


b) The level of the service is as good as or better than the existing standard of service following the
new excavation works;


c) All practicable steps have been taken to minimise the level of disruption;


d) Council has been informed of excavation works and all steps have been taken to follow standards
and conditions of notification;


e) Any affected or potentially affected persons have been notified in advance of the proposed
disruption;


f) Remediation and reinstatement works have been completed to the same or higher standard than
prior to the initiation of works;


g) Sub-soil drains are designed and constructed to manage the effects of mass earthworks, without the
need for on-going monitoring and maintenance by Council;


h) All sub-soil drains are geotechnically designed and certified.


**8.2 Referenced Documents**


**8.2.1** **Resource Management Plan Requirements**


The Standards set out in this chapter address matters that are specific to Council asset creation or activities
that may have an impact on an asset. They are subject to the Nelson City and Tasman District Resource
Management Plans. Key sections of the plans that may relate to trenching and reinstatement works are
earthworks and land disturbance provisions.


**8.2.2** **External Standards**


Unless otherwise specified within the standards of this document, earthworks, trenching and reinstatement
management networks will be designed and constructed in a manner consistent with the standards set out in
Table 8-1. Where an Act or National Standard document is referenced, this will be the current version
including any associated amendments.

**STANDARDS**


**8.3 Design**


This set of standards relates to the general preparation and process requirements of trenching and
reinstatement on public land.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met with trenching and reinstatement works:


**8.3.1** **General**


8.3.1.1 Except for transformers and cabinets and unless resolved otherwise by the Council, all new
telecommunications, broadcasting and electricity cables, fittings and equipment in the road reserve
will be laid underground.


8.3.1.2 Only operators approved by the Council will be permitted to undertake trenching and reinstatement
works within road reserves within the Council’s area. See Chapter 2, Qualifications, Process and
Information Requirements.


**8.3.2** **Corridor Access Requests**


8.3.2.1 A Corridor Access Request (CAR) as set out in the ‘National Code of Practice for Utilities, Access
to the Transport Corridors’ is required to be lodged by the operator at the Council for each separate
job or section of a continuing job, which involves excavation, or the lifting of the surface within a
road reserve. Further information about CAR applications and fees is available on the Council’s
website.


8.3.2.2 For minor work the CAR must be lodged at least five working days before work starts, unless
otherwise agreed. For major and project work, the CAR must be lodged at least fifteen working
days before work starts, unless otherwise agreed.


8.3.2.3 Where emergency maintenance is necessary, the notice will be lodged on the next working day. If
the road involved is a State Highway, the notice will require confirmation that the New Zealand
Transport Agency has been notified and if any special conditions imposed by that body have been
received.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 8 - Earthworks, Trenching and

Reinstatement Management Page 2/13


8.3.2.4 Plans of the proposed work will be submitted to the Council with the CAR. The plans will be to a
scale of 1:500 or 1:200 where needed for clarity and shall show the location and size of all existing
and proposed cables, conduits, pipes, underground structures, property boundaries and kerb lines.
Unless agreed otherwise, dimensions to boundaries and kerbs will be shown and proposed depths
below existing surface levels shall be shown at regular intervals.


8.3.2.5 As-built plans will be made available on request of the Corridor Manager and no later than three
months following the completion of the works.


8.3.2.6 The operator will advise other affected Service Authorities a minimum of 15 days prior to any
proposed construction works. Confirmation that other affected Service Authorities have been
advised of planned works shall be indicated on the CAR.


8.3.2.7 Providing that all required information has been supplied with the CAR, the Council will issue a
Work Approval Notice (WAN) and advice of existing Council services in the locality and any
specific conditions related to the proposal. No works may commence in advance of the WAN being
issued. WAN are valid for six months from the date of issue unless agreed otherwise by the
Engineering Manager.


8.3.2.8 A charge for each WAN issued will be made in accordance with the fees and charges that may be
set by the Council from time to time.


**8.4 Construction**


This set of standards relates to the physical works associated with trenching and reinstatement construction
practices.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met when undertaking trenching and reinstatement of
underground services:


**8.4.1** **General**


8.4.1.1 Normal work hours will be between 0700-1800 hours, Monday to Saturday. Works on arterial
streets may be limited to 0900-1600 hours or other hours as may be appropriate.


8.4.1.2 Work hours within the Nelson Central City, Stoke, Richmond, Motueka and Takaka town centres,
will be as approved by the Council.


8.4.1.3 During any construction in the street, the disruption to the public and adjacent residents will be kept

8.4.1.5 Trench reinstatement in carriageways and footpaths will be as shown in SD801 and SD802.


**8.4.2** **Notice**


8.4.2.1 Prior to planned excavation commencing, the operator will give written notice (48 hours) to all
affected residents and business owners of the nature of the work and who to contact for further

information or to convey complaints.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 8 - Earthworks, Trenching and

Reinstatement and Management Page 3/13


8.4.2.2 There will be 24 hours’ notice given to the occupiers of any property which will have its access
blocked for more than one hour and will be notified in writing and in sufficient time to enable them
to remove any vehicles etc from their property. The operator will also ensure parked cars etc are
moved off the site.


8.4.2.3 All operators who carry out work which may impact on the normal use of the roads and/or footpaths
must submit a Traffic Management Plan to Council for approval before commencing works.


8.4.2.4 The operator will, as a minimum, comply with the requirements of the Council Traffic Management
Guidelines and submit a Traffic Management Plan prior to the commencement of work.


8.4.2.5 The operator will be responsible for the supply, erection and maintenance of all necessary
barricades, lights, warning notices, traffic control signs etc.


**8.4.3** **Street closure**


8.4.3.1 The carriageway will be fully open to traffic during hours of darkness and not more than half the
carriageway shall be closed at any one time, except with the express permission in writing of the
Council.


8.4.3.2 Any street closed to any traffic must obtain specific written approval of the Council.


8.4.3.3 The closure of any streets requires public notification.


8.4.3.4 Application to close a street for infrastructure-related activities must be lodged at Council at least
40 days prior to the day of the proposed closure.


8.4.3.5 Approval for street closure will only be given where all other options are unsatisfactory.


**8.4.4** **Underground services**


8.4.4.1 The positioning of services or mains, wherever possible, will be in accordance with SD412 and
SD413.


8.4.4.2 The operator will make itself fully aware of the position of all underground services in the locality,
before commencing work.


8.4.4.3 Variations from these alignments will be by written agreement from the Council, following
discussions with other affected Service Authorities.


8.4.4.4 Where existing services are damaged as a result of the construction work, the operator will
immediately advise the owner of the damaged services, (public or private).


8.4.4.5 The cost of repair or reinstatement of any disturbances or damage to any water pipe, sewer or
stormwater drain, other underground services or structure, will be borne by the operator.


**8.4.5** **Road marking**


8.4.5.1 All works that are likely to cause damage to any road markings must be brought to the attention of
the Council in order that they may be replaced at the earliest possible opportunity for the safety of
the general public.


8.4.5.2 The operator will be responsible for the cost of any remarking that is necessary.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 8 - Earthworks, Trenching and

Reinstatement Management Page 4/13


8.4.5.3 All road marking will be undertaken by a registered Road Marking Contractor to the current New
Zealand Transport Agency standards.


8.4.5.4 Road marking will be completed within five days of resurfacing. Limit lines must be replaced when
trafficked. This can be a temporary marking for the first five days.


8.4.5.5 All edgelines, centrelines, continuity lines and limit lines will be reflectorised road markings.


**8.4.6** **Managing Disturbances**


8.4.6.1 The operator will avoid disturbance to any survey marks within the vicinity of their work. Where any
survey marks are disturbed, the cost of replacing and re-surveying the mark shall be met by the
operator.


8.4.6.2 Reinstatement of geo-fabrics and geogrids will be undertaken as detailed on SD806.


8.4.6.3 Trenchless technology will only be used in specific circumstances where approved by the
Engineering Manager.


8.4.6.4 The maximum permitted length of trench to be open shall be 100m unless specifically authorised
by the Council. Notwithstanding this, the operator will not exceed any length that is not capable of
being backfilled and opened to traffic in the same day, nor will it interfere with two-way traffic flow.


8.4.6.5 Trench widths will be kept to the minimum necessary to lay the service and correctly compact the
backfill.


8.4.6.6 Open trenches will not be permitted overnight without the prior authority of the Council.


8.4.6.7 All works that are likely to cause damage to any trees, shrubs, or ornamental gardens within the
road reserve, will be brought to the attention of the Council prior to work commencing. It will be the
operator's responsibility to make good or replace any damaged trees, shrubs or ornamental
gardens.


8.4.6.8 All open trenches will be maintained in a dewatered condition and water-logged material removed
to the satisfaction of the Council. Sediment laden water from any excavation will be disposed of to
the stormwater main via a sediment retention device or settlement tank to minimise sedimentation

and avoid damage or nuisance.


8.4.6.9 The operator will take all due care to prevent excavated and stockpiled material from being washed
into the stormwater system in the event of rain occurring during a trenching operation


8.4.6.10 Where damage occurs to existing kerb and channel the damage will be made good to the

satisfaction of the Council. Where any kerb and channel requires replacing this shall be done by
the Council’s approved kerbing contractor at the operator's expense.


8.4.6.11 Where work is to take place within 50m of traffic signals the operator will consult with the Council.


8.4.6.12 The operator will liaise with the Council to locate the traffic signals communication network.


8.4.6.13 All earthworks and land disturbance activity will cease immediately upon the discovery of cultural

heritage artefacts, in accordance with the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 8 - Earthworks, Trenching and

Reinstatement and Management Page 5/13


8.4.6.14 Where there is a known high risk of accidental discovery, a cultural heritage monitor must be

present during all excavation works.


**8.4.7** **Restoration and Remediation**


8.4.7.1 As work proceeds the operator will progressively carry out all restoration and tidying up work.


8.4.7.2 On completion of the work, the operator will remove all plant, materials and other things that may
have been brought upon the site in aid of the works, and generally clear away all rubbish and leave
the site in a similar or better condition to that which existed before the work was commenced.


8.4.7.3 Any trees or branches cut down or tree stumps uprooted during the work will be removed.


8.4.7.4 If regular tidying up and restoration is not being done, the Council will require and instruct the
operator concerned to carry out this work immediately.


8.4.7.5 The operator will, at its own expense, clean out all sumps and repair or reinstate all road surfaces,
fencing, walls, floors, lawns, gardens, paths, inclusive of transplanting trees and shrubs, and make
good all damage which may have been caused through his operations to at least as good as the
"as found condition" in connection with the work.


8.4.7.6 Surface reinstatement (including the final or temporary sealing) will be completed prior to vehicle
and pedestrian traffic being permitted to use the surface. Surface reinstatement shall be completed
within five days of the trench being opened or such other period agreed by the Council.


8.4.7.7 Where work is required within an area that has been re-surfaced within the last two years an
alternative route must be identified. If this is not possible then, depending on the position and
nature of the excavation, a full width reinstatement may be required. Where a full width
reinstatement is required, then the length of the reinstatement will be not less than the width of the
carriageway (or footpath).


8.4.7.8 All temporary markings to locate services will be removed on completion of the works.


8.4.7.9 All permanent surface reinstatement on carriageways will be completed with the finished wearing
surface depth, matching that of the existing road and finishing flush with the final seal level or as
per Section 4.17.5.4. All parts of the surface damaged during or as a result of the work will have a
reinstated sealed surface. Excavations that are closer than 1.0m horizontal to the existing edge of
the seal, kerb and channel, or previous excavation reinstatement, or joint will have a reinstated
sealed surface that extends to join with the existing edge of seal, kerb and channel or adjacent
reinstatement.


8.4.7.10 Subject to favourable weather conditions, appropriate Polymer Modified Bandage (PMB) 100mm

wide by 1.5mm thick, will be completed within five days of resurfacing.


8.4.7.11 Service boxes, e.g. water hydrant boxes, manholes etc will be installed in their final location during

trench compaction and their finished level shall be finished flush with or no more than 5mm above
the reinstated pavement surface. All service boxes and lids will be raised and adjusted to final level
prior to placement of surfacing seal coat.


8.4.7.12 For State Highways, refer to New Zealand Transport Agency requirements.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 8 - Earthworks, Trenching and

Reinstatement Management Page 6/13


8.4.7.13 All permanent surface reinstatement on footpaths will be completed with a finished surface

matching the existing and finishing flush with the existing surface. The minimum dimension of any
reinstated portion of the footpath will not be less than 600mm wide. The width of remaining
undamaged footpath will not be less than 1.0m. If these criteria cannot be met the reinstatement
will be across the full width of the footpath. Also, the full width of the footpath will be replaced when
trenching in footpaths within the Central Business District (CBD) areas, or Arterial, and Principal
roads or new footpaths with a sealed surface less than two years old, see SD803, SD804 and
SD805.


8.4.7.14 In concrete footpaths the depth will match the existing with a minimum thickness of 100mm and the

concrete shall attain a minimum compressive strength of 27.5 MPa after 28 days, as per SD406
and SD407. Construction joints will be formed at 6.0m centres and the line and level of the finished
surface shall match the crossfall and level of the adjacent undamaged surface.


8.4.7.15 In footpaths, service boxes, e.g. water hydrant boxes, manholes etc will be installed in their final

location during trench compaction and their finished level will be finished flush with the reinstated
pavement surface. All surface boxes and lids will be raised and adjusted to final level prior to
placement of surfacing seal coat.


8.4.7.16 For reinstatement within grassed berms see Chapter 4, Section 4.15.2.


8.4.7.17 Alternatively, turfs may be cut from the berm 75mm in thickness and 50mm wider than the trench

and stacked for re-use. Full reinstatement will be achieved within 48 hours with screened top soil
being raked into all cut joints, with all turfs being adequately watered immediately following
completion of reinstatement.


8.4.7.18 Service boxes etc will be finished to the tolerances specified in Chapter 4, Section 4.17.5.4 unless

in a planted/landscaped (non-pedestrian) area then surface lids will be finished to 40mm higher
than surrounding finished surface.


8.4.7.19 The operator will notify the Council (via a Works Completion Notice) immediately upon the

completion of final reinstatement so that an inspection may be made of the completed surface
reinstatement works.


8.4.7.20 The operator will be held responsible for any street maintenance work required as a result of the

excavation and reinstatement operations for a minimum of 24 months after notification to the
Council that the final surfacing material has been applied including Polymer Modified Bitumen
(PMB) and Road Marking. Any such maintenance work required by Council will be undertaken by
the operator at the operator's cost within five working days of being notified by the Council to
undertake repair works.


8.4.7.21 If on the grounds of safety, there is a need for more immediate action this remedial work will be

completed within 48 hours or such other time as may be directed by the Council. Should this not be
complied with, Council reserves the right to arrange or undertake such maintenance work and this
work will be at the cost of the operator. The maintenance period will start from the time that the
Council is notified of completion of remedial works.


**8.4.8** **Surface Excavation**


8.4.8.1 When an excavation is required to be made through any cement concrete, asphaltic concrete or
chip seal surface, the proposed edges of the excavation or trench will be cut with a power saw prior
to the excavation of the trench. The cut is to extend through the full thickness of the surface layer in


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 8 - Earthworks, Trenching and

Reinstatement and Management Page 7/13


a clean straight vertical line. The cut will be 150mm beyond and parallel to the edge of the trench
or to a line outside any pavement damage, whichever is greater. Within footpaths all saw cuts will
be parallel to or at right angles to the centreline of the footpath.


8.4.8.2 Only wet cutting will be permitted in the CBD, in the vicinity of Suburban Shopping Centres or
where directed by the Council, to minimise the problems caused by dust.


8.4.8.3 Unless approved otherwise by the Engineering Manager, all excavated material will be removed
from the site immediately as excavation proceeds.


8.4.8.4 Areas adjacent to the excavation will not be undercut. If slumping of material from the sides of the
excavation causes depressed areas adjacent to the excavation or if the edges of the pavement are
lifted during excavation, additional saw cutting outside of the original line of the excavation and
outside the area of damage will be required before reinstatement is permitted.





Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 8 - Earthworks, Trenching and

Reinstatement Management Page 8/13


**8.5 Excavation**


This section deals with excavation, back filling, and surface re-instatement.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met in all excavation and re-instatement works:


**8.5.1** **General**


8.5.1.1 The backfilling of excavations will be undertaken in accordance with SD801 and SD803 using
imported backfill material that comply with New Zealand Transport Agency specifications.


8.5.1.2 Basecourse used in the Pavement section of the backfill will be to New Zealand Transport Agency
(TNZ) M/4 Specifications.


8.5.1.3 The material used for bedding underneath and around the service or service duct will be as
required in Chapter, 7, Section 7.8.6.


8.5.1.4 Surface reinstatement (including the final or temporary sealing) will be completed prior to vehicle
and pedestrian traffic being permitted to use the surface. In all other situations, surface
reinstatement will be completed within five days of the trench being opened or such other period as
directed by the Council.


8.5.1.5 Variation from this condition will require the written agreement of the Council. For works within the
CBD or Arterial Roads, surface reinstatement will be completed within 24 hours of the trench being
opened or such other period as directed by the Council.


8.5.1.6 Failure to complete reinstatement within the specified period may result in Council arranging
reinstatement at the operator's expense.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 8 - Earthworks, Trenching and

Reinstatement and Management Page 9/13


8.5.1.7 All excavations will be backfilled, as detailed on SD801, SD802 and SD803 to the underside of the
proposed wearing surface, or to the finished level if permanent reinstatement is not being
undertaken immediately. This temporary over filling will be removed when permanent
reinstatement is carried out.


8.5.1.8 If permanent reinstatement cannot be undertaken immediately, in areas to be reopened for vehicle
or pedestrian use, the operator will arrange for a 10mm thick layer of fine ’Cold Mix’ or a rubberised
pre-fabricated chip seal with 100mm over lap laid to manufacturer’s instructions to be applied to the
trench immediately backfilling is completed.


8.5.1.9 Where work is required within an area that has been re-surfaced within the last two years an
alternative route must be identified. If this is not possible then, depending on the position and
nature of the excavation, a full width reinstatement may be required. Where a full width
reinstatement is required, then the length of the reinstatement will be not less than the width of the
carriageway (or footpath).


8.5.1.10 All temporary markings to locate services will be removed on completion of the works.


8.5.1.11 All parts of the surface damaged during or as a result of the work will be reinstated to maintain the

cross-fall slope. Finished levels will be compatible with the existing pavement.


8.5.1.12 All permanent surface reinstatement and sealed surface on carriageways will be completed as

shown on SD801, SD802, SD803 and SD806, with the finished wearing surface depth, matching
that of the existing road and finishing flush with or no more than 5mm above the existing surface.


8.5.1.13 Excavations (including the final saw cut edge) that are closer than 1.0m horizontal to the existing

edge of the seal, kerb and channel, previous excavation reinstatement, or joint will have a
reinstated sealed surface that extends to join with the existing edge of seal, kerb and channel or
adjacent reinstatement.


8.5.1.14 Subject to favourable weather conditions, an appropriate Polymer Modified Bandage (PMB)

100mm wide by 1.5mm thick, will be completed within five days of resurfacing.


8.5.1.15 On unsealed rural roads and metal shoulders backfilling will be as for chip sealed carriageways

with 50mm of top course being placed as the final reinstatement. Finished levels will be compatible
with the existing pavement.


8.5.1.16 Service boxes, for example; water hydrant boxes, manholes etc will be installed in their final

location during trench compaction and their finished level will be finished flush with or no more than
5mm above the reinstated pavement surface. All service boxes and lids will be raised and adjusted
to final level prior to placement of surfacing seal coat.


8.5.1.17 For State Highways, refer to New Zealand Transport Agency requirements.


**8.5.2** **Footpath Reinstatement**


8.5.2.1 All permanent surface reinstatement on footpaths will be completed as shown on SD803SD806 with a finished surface matching the existing and finishing flush with the existing surface.
The minimum dimension of any reinstated portion of the footpath will not be less than 600mm wide.


8.5.2.2 The width of remaining undamaged footpath will not be less than 1.0m. (See SD803). If these
criteria cannot be met the reinstatement will be across the full width of the footpath. Also, the full


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 8 - Earthworks, Trenching and

Reinstatement Management Page 10/13


width of the footpath will be replaced when trenching in footpaths within the Nelson Central City,
Stoke, Richmond, Motueka and Takaka Centre areas, or Arterial, and Principal roads or new
footpaths with a sealed surface less than two years old.


8.5.2.3 Vehicle crossings which are affected by the work will be reinstated with a minimum of 150mm thick
concrete for residential crossings, 200mm thick concrete for commercial crossings, while industrial
crossings are to match existing with a minimum of 300mm thick concrete. Concrete for commercial
and industrial entrance slabs will be reinforced with 665 WWF (see SD409).


8.5.2.4 Note: In asphaltic concrete and chip sealed footpaths the depth of basecourse at vehicle crossings
will match the depth of the existing basecourse, with a minimum depth of 300mm for industrial

**8.6 Subsoil drainage**


This section deals with the use, design and construction of sub-soil drains.


**Mandatory Matters**


Council requires the following standards to be met where sub-soil drains are used:


8.6.1.1 Geotechnical assessments will be carried out by a geotechnical professional whenever the
situations stated in NZS4404 Clause 2.1 are present.


8.6.1.2 The geotechnical professional will carry out the functions listed in NZS4404 Clause 2.2.4, as well
as the following:


a) Provide Geotechnical Report, including Site Investigation, Interpretation and Analysis;


b) Incorporate and describe how Engineering Redundancy is achieved within the design;


c) Demonstrate engineering redundancy via a Quantitative Slope Stability Analysis.


8.6.1.3 A risk review will be undertaken by the geotechnical professional and will be recorded as a risk
register. The risk review will include:


a) Compiling a list of geo-hazards present at the site;


b) Compiling a list of risks to the sub soil drainage system (such as geo-hazards, tree roots,
post construction, directional drilling, construction errors, vandalism, future infrastructure for
example; house foundations, retaining wall foundations etc) and listing proposed mitigation
techniques (such as subsoil drainage zones, limits of deep foundations, application of
contingency designs (directional drilling);


c) Assessing the impact of a worst-case slope failure which considers risk to the private
properties, council infrastructure and adjoining properties.


8.6.1.4 Type A Subsoil drains are defined as subsoil drains that are an integral part of the mass
earthworks, and the Geotechnical Certification is subject to these drains remaining in good working
order at all times and operating as designed.


8.6.1.5 Type-A Subsoil Drains will not be permitted in Nelson or Tasman regions either as a public or
private asset.


8.6.1.6 Type B subsoil drains are defined as subsoil drains that are a requirement of the earthworks design
and construction, but the guaranteed ongoing operation of these drains is not required for ongoing
land stability and there is no requirement by the certifying Geotechnical Engineer that these drains
need to be monitored and maintained.


8.6.1.7 Council will not accept these drains as a vested asset pursuant to any development of private land.


8.6.1.8 Subsoil drains must be designed and constructed in a way that allows them to be inspected
internally using CCTV. This will be undertaken after trench backfill is completed but prior to major
earthworks, and the information including video and a short report provided to the Council.


8.6.1.9 Prior to 224 certification, subsoil drains are to be inspected by CCTV and that CCTV inspection is
to be reviewed by the certifying Geotechnical Engineer and certified as acceptable.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 8 - Earthworks, Trenching and

Reinstatement Management Page 12/13


8.6.1.10 Prior to 224 certification, Geotechnical Certification must be provided to Council by the certifying

Geotechnical Engineer confirming that the subsoil drains are not required as a means of instability
risk management. Geotechnical Certification must be made by a suitably qualified Chartered
Professional Engineer.


8.6.1.11 Prior to 224 certification, As-Built plans for the entire subsoil drain system will be provided to

Council, detailing the surveyed alignment and depth to finished ground levels for the entire subsoil
drain system.


8.6.1.12 Prior to 224 certification, subsoil drains must be legally protected (for example; through easement)

from being built or constructed over, including appropriate requirements, detailed by the certifying
Geotechnical Engineer, if building adjacent or over the subsoil drains is anticipated.

Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 9 – Telecommunications, Electrical,

Streetlighting Page 4/18


**9.7 Electrical Reticulation Design**


This section outlines general design requirements for all electrical utilities.


**Mandatory Matters**


The Council requires the following standards to be met in the provision of electrical utilities.


**9.7.1** **General**


9.7.1.1 All new service mains will be by underground cabling in “rural areas” or as approved by the
Council and the utility operator.


9.7.1.2 Reinforcement or replacement of existing overhead works will be by underground cabling
apart from specific exemption from the Council. This will not exclude the line owner carrying
out any maintenance (replacement or upgrade) of existing works as long as the land will not
be injuriously affected as a result of the maintenance (replacement or upgrade).


9.7.1.3 Any variations (exceptional circumstances) given by either the line owner (for variation from its
own electrical design and construction standards) or the Council (for variation from its Land
Development Manual) will be in writing and shall indicate which section and subsection of the
relevant standards the variation applies to.


9.7.1.4 Existing allotments with no “power to the boundary” and requiring an electrical supply will be
by underground cabling.


9.7.1.5 All works assets to be vested with the line owner or electricity operator will meet their
respective design and construction standards and distribution code.


9.7.1.6 Any underground or overhead works cable being vested with the electricity operator and
installed on any titled land will be secured by way of an easement in favour of the line owner.
See Section 9.9.


9.7.1.7 Service main exclusive fittings owned by a third party will also have private easements
registered outside the point of supply if the route crosses titled land not owned by the third
party. See Section 9.11.


9.7.1.8 Where a boundary is adjusted enabling a lot to contain an installation the Council will require
confirmation from the line owner that the existing works are sufficient to supply another
installation as required.


9.7.1.9 Designers are to liaise with other service authorities to achieve economical use of the road
reserve area with due consideration given to ease of maintenance to the works system and
other services in the road reserve area.


**9.7.2** **Design**


9.7.2.1 All new works and service mains will be by underground cabling in urban areas.


9.7.2.2 The design of the works shall, as a minimum requirement, comply with the current Electricity
Regulations and the requirements and standards of the line owner.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 – Chapter 9 – Telecommunication, Electrical and

Streetlighting Page 5/18


9.7.2.3 The design of the works shall give consideration to the likely electrical demand requirements
per lot and allow for this in the initial design.


9.7.2.4 The minimum electrical demand design criteria per lot and allowable after diversity maximum
demand factor, shall be to the requirements of the line owner.


9.7.2.5 All new residential, commercial and industrial subdivisions shall be reticulated with
underground cabling running along each side of the road reserve. The Council may allow
variation for a single sided reticulation in exceptional circumstances (e.g. where lot frontages
are greater than 30m in length).


9.7.2.6 Provision shall be made by land developers for the continuation of appropriate cabling along
road frontages to facilitate the works of adjoining future development. This may be achieved
by the installation of cable ducting systems. The Council may waive this requirement where it
is demonstrated, with approval from the line owner, that adjacent sub-dividable land may be
reticulated from another suitable route.


9.7.2.7 Consideration shall be given to the future extension or reinforcement of the works system
without necessitating major road reserve disturbance to achieve such expansion or
reinforcement. Where appropriate, spare ducting shall be installed along routes likely to be
used for an extension, or reinforcement of the works.


9.7.2.8 Road crossings for power cables shall be kept to a minimum and where necessary, shall be at
right angles to the carriageway and have minimum cover of 900mm. All power cables crossing
the road shall be in an orange electrical duct of minimum diameter 100mm. Streetlight cables
shall be inside a separate orange 50mm diameter electrical duct.


**9.7.3** **Location and Capacity**


9.7.3.1 Voltage drop shall be no greater than permitted under the current Electricity (Safety)
Regulations and the requirements and standards of the line owner.


9.7.3.2 Current ratings shall be in accordance with line owner’s design and construction standards,
and relevant legislation.


9.7.3.3 The design shall take into account the requirements of Section 9.7.2 with specific attention
given to the following details relating to likely electrical loads:


a) Lot size in relation to permissible coverage and anticipated usage of the lot (e.g. multiple

dwellings, cross-lease and potential subdivision permitted within the zoning);


b) An appropriate after diversity maximum demand factor;


c) The design of the works shall give consideration to the likely electrical demand

requirements per lot and allow for this in the initial design. Residential subdivisions should
allow a minimum of 15kVA with diversity per lot and industrial subdivisions should allow a
minimum of 40kVA without diversity per lot;


d) Future load growth and works expansion or reinforcement.


9.7.3.4 Existing overhead electrical cabling shall be dealt with in accordance with Section 9.10.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 9 – Telecommunications, Electrical,

Streetlighting Page 6/18


**9.7.4** **Records**


9.7.4.1 The network utility operator shall keep and maintain as-built records of their works within the
road reserve and on private property where the reticulation will be owned by the line owner in
[accordance with the Electrical (Safety) Regulations 2010.](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2010/0036/latest/DLM2763501.html)


9.7.4.2 The line owner shall ensure that they receive and maintain as-built records of the works and
ensure that such records are made available upon request and as required, mark out cable
routes on site for the Council or contractors carrying out works.


9.7.4.3 Provision of as-built drawings for planned works shall be made available with five working
days’ notice during normal working hours and for emergency call outs with no prior notice at
any time.









**9.8 Electrical Reticulation, Easements and Subdivision**


This section details standards that relate to subdivision and easements, as these matters affect and are
affected by the provision of electrical reticulation.


**Mandatory Matters**


The Council requires the following standards to be met in the provision of electrical reticulation,
easements and subdivision.


9.8.1.1 New lots shall be serviced with live 400/230v works to the boundary of each lot.


9.8.1.2 High voltage power lines (greater than 1000 volts) across or fronting new subdivisions shall be
relocated clear of the subdivisions or placed underground with the agreement of the line
owner. Variation may be granted by the Council where it is demonstrated to be impractical to
achieve this requirement.


9.8.1.3 All new subdivisions reticulated with service boxes or poles shall have service ducting (50mm
orange PVC electrical duct) from the pole or box to 1.0m within the property it is intended to
supply. Wide sweeping bends shall be used. Service ducting shall be installed to the depths
shown on SD901 and SD902. Duct ends shall be clearly marked within properties, and fixed
by measurement to survey points or other permanent fixtures on as built records.

Streetlighting Page 7/18


**9.8.2** **Broadband Speed**


9.8.2.1 The network design will provide a minimum of 25 M bps transfer speeds with provision for this
to be increased to 100 M bps without necessitating major road reserve disturbance.


**9.9 Easements**


9.9.1.1 It is the responsibility of the Developer to ensure that all easements are obtainable. The
Developer shall, where necessary and at their expense, provide any easements and obtain
any formal consents required for overhead lines, underground cabling and equipment to be
installed or altered in, on, under or over property other than road reserve.


9.9.1.2 Easements in Gross with the line owner as the grantee/transferee shall be obtained and
registered on all private land.


9.9.1.3 Easements are required in the following cases but shall not be limited to:


a) Where new works (lines or cables) are located on private properties;


b) Where a pad mount substation, switching station or transformer is to be located on other

than road reserve;


c) Where an overhead line located in a legal road intrudes into a privately-owned property.

This applies especially to cross arms and conductors where air space is encroached;


d) Where an existing service main is physically altered, shifted or its status is changed, for

example, to supply a new separately subdivided property;


e) Where a network cable is used to supply lot(s) in rights-of-way or access lots.


9.9.1.4 Easements required on land being developed under subdivision consent must be described
under a memorandum of easements. Land outside the subdivision and affected by new or
altered network system changes must also be described in a memorandum of easements.
Where lot servicing is able to be satisfied using service mains in rights-of-way or access lots,
easements shall be prescribed on the deposited plan.


9.9.1.5 Works are to be vested with the line owner prior to connection and livening, and registration of
the easement. A separate agreement will be required to confirm vestment conditions and will
be signed by approved signatories.


9.9.1.6 Overhead lines require 6.0m wide easement corridors symmetrical to the actual line route.


9.9.1.7 Underground cables require 3.0m wide easement corridors symmetrical to the actual cable

route.


**9.10 Rural Areas**


9.10.1.1 Easements in gross are to be provided by the land owner, in favour of the line owner, for all
new or altered works over private property. All proposed electricity easements over private
property, whether the land is owned by the developer or not, must be listed under a
memorandum of easements in gross on the subdivision plans.


9.10.1.2 400/230v works and service mains to individual premises shall be by underground cable
unless precluded by ground profiles or other impediments in which case the Council may grant
variation for overhead cables to traverse the area concerned.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 9 – Telecommunications, Electrical,

Streetlighting Page 8/18


9.10.1.3 Network connection points to individual lot boundaries shall be located to provide practical and
legal access for service mains to specified or potential building sites.


9.10.1.4 Where the length of a service mains cable exceeds 200m from a network connection point to a
specified or potential building site, the works designer shall state on the application drawing,
the proposed service mains cable size and design criteria applicable to the lot.

The Council requires the following standards to be met in the design of cabling, ducting and service

boxes:


**9.11.1 General**


9.11.1.1 Access to a three-phase power supply shall be provided at the boundary of the road frontage
of each lot of an industrial, commercial or residential subdivision.


9.11.1.2 Rights-of-way exceeding 60.0m to any allotment shall have an appropriate power cable
installed to the main body of the rear allotments.


9.11.1.3 Fusing and “network connection points” shall be to the satisfaction of the line owner. No
service duct system extending from a service box, within a right-of-way shall be longer than
60.0m. No service duct system in road reserve shall be longer than 10.0m.


9.11.1.4 Where either the service mains or the line owner’s works is installed within the sealed area of

a right-of-way the cable is to be installed within a duct or a spare duct is to be laid beside the
cable.


9.11.1.5 Appropriate registration of easements in gross to the line owner’s requirements shall be
provided by the landowners prior to livening for all works. Where service cables cross other
properties or rights-of-way, private easements between lots will be required prior to livening.


9.11.1.6 Any ducting systems installed in the road reserve area shall be considered as part of the
works system for the purpose of as-built records.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 9 – Telecommunications, Electrical,

Streetlighting Page 10/18


9.11.1.7 Any excavation within the existing road reserve is subject to the Councils’ approval including
the National Code of Practice for Utilities Access to the Road and Rail Corridors and a

Corridor Access approval issued by the Council.


9.11.1.8 Service boxes shall be set back 250mm from section boundaries and are to be clear of

designated vehicular access and pedestrian ways by a minimum of 1.2m along the boundary
and 700mm diagonally to the nearest point where the driveway tapers out to the kerb, refer to
SD903.


9.11.1.9 The minimum spacing of any service box from any boundary line or survey peg shall be
250mm so as to enable future fencing construction.

being 600mm from section boundaries at a nominal laying depth of 1.0m (900mm cover) with
provision for shared trenching with communication services.


9.11.1.11 All joints in duct pipe shall be watertight and shall use rubber ring seals, depending on the

ducting supplied. The rubber “o” ring sealed pipe is the preferred type of duct and will replace
solvent cement glued ducting in the long term.


**9.11.2 Substations**


9.11.2.1 Substations shall be of adequate design capability to supply the anticipated after diversity
maximum demand with consideration to Section 9.7.3.


9.11.2.2 Ground-mounted substations will be permitted within new residential, commercial and
industrial subdivisions.


9.11.2.3 Substations shall be located in the berm, (recessed into adjoining lot or public reserve) clear of
designated vehicular access ways by a minimum of 1.0m and close to section frontages (but
no closer than 300mm), secured either by easement or preferably designated as road reserve.
The line owner is to determine the size of the recess.


9.11.2.4 Adequate public protection shall be provided at all substation sites, giving consideration to:


a) Earthing (NZECP 35);


b) Physical location to minimise the risk of damage by vehicles; and


c) Security to protect against public access to electrical contents.


**9.11.3 Approvals and Records**


9.11.3.1 Prior to any works commencing on site, the following requirements shall be submitted and
approved:


9.11.3.2 A line owner’s approved electrical works design plan and the designated streetlight connection
point.


9.11.3.3 The plan shall bear a design statement covering the following:


a) Before diversity load per lot (i.e. 15 kVA per residential lot);


b) Compliance with the line owner’s design and construction standards;


c) Compliance with the Land Development Manual.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 – Chapter 9 – Telecommunication, Electrical and

Streetlighting Page 11/18


9.11.3.4 A list of easement requirements for any works on titled land to be vested with the line owner
and a list of reciprocal rights for service mains cables or ducts over shared rights-of-way or
easements for service mains cables crossing titled land.


9.11.3.5 The Council signed approval of the design plan (for subdivision or large area works).


9.11.3.6 Prior to the 224-certification stage (for subdivision), the following details shall be forwarded via
the Designer to the Council:


a) A letter of acceptance by the line owner confirming that adequate services are provided:


b) As-built documentation has been filed for network extensions and/or service mains; and


c) The works has been livened and fulfils the line owner’s design and construction standards

and any other line owner requirements.


9.11.3.7 Regarding cable locations, the location and layout of the works shall be shown on the design
plan, with all variations authorised by the network line operator’s representative.


9.11.3.8 Where a shared services trench is used, separation between the services in subdivisions is
required. These will be detailed in the laying specification. However, safe working distances
are required for all services within minimum separations for power cables. Table 9-2 shows
the minimum clearances between power and telecommunications cables. SD901 and SD902
show the general layout of services.


**Table 9-2 Minimum Separations Between Power and Telecommunications Cables**

exceeding 50 volts a.c. or 120 volts ripple free d.c. but not exceeding 1000 volts a.c. or 1500volts
d.c.

HV (high voltage) power cable is defined in the current electricity regulations as “any voltage
exceeding 1000 volts a.c. or 1500 volts d.c.



**9.11.4 Protection**


9.11.4.1 The depth and offset of trenches will be specified on the laying plan. It is essential that these
be maintained. Minimum cover shall generally be as shown on SD901, SD902 and SD904.


9.11.4.2 All services crossing the proposed duct pipe route shall be exposed and the necessary
clearances maintained to enable other network line operator’s ducts to be installed either
above or below these other services. Telecommunication ducts shall be laid above power
cables, but not directly above.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 9 – Telecommunications, Electrical,

Streetlighting Page 12/18


9.11.4.3 Appropriate mechanical protection shall be provided for any underground works in accordance

route at half the cable trench depth unless the cable is mole-tunnelled or drilled and ducted.









**9.12 Streetlighting**


This section contains standards for the design and installation of streetlighting.


**Mandatory Matters**


The Council requires the following standards to be met in the design of streetlighting:


**9.12.1 General**


9.12.1.1 The lighting design must maximise safety and efficiency while minimising the life cycle cost
and impact on the environment.


9.12.1.2 Lighting shall be designed to match the style, height and spacing of adjoining sections of road
that have the same hierarchical classification.


9.12.1.3 Lighting should complement the neighbourhood character and, as far as is reasonably
practicable, minimise the impact on the neighbouring properties and environment with regard


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 – Chapter 9 – Telecommunication, Electrical and

Streetlighting Page 13/18


to aesthetics, topography, elevations, glare and light spill. The Councils’ support the dark night
sky concept.


9.12.1.4 The design must comply with all the appropriate New Zealand Standards, in particular the
requirements of AS/NZS 1158 and New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) M30
specifications. Anything not specified within the Land Development Manual is specified in
those standards.


9.12.1.5 Pedestrian area (Category P) lighting must comply with AS/NZS 1158.3.1 and for pedestrian
crossings AS/NZS 1158.4. Vehicle area (Category V) lighting must comply with
AS/NZS 1158.1.2.


9.12.1.6 Category V lighting should provide a lighted environment conducive to the safe and
comfortable movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic at night.


9.12.1.7 Category P lighting should assist pedestrians to orientate themselves and detect potential
hazards, and discourage fear of crime and crime against the person.


9.12.1.8 New roads and public accessways shall have lighting levels and parameters by roading
hierarchy classifications (refer Section 4 Transportation). The lighting level associated with
that classification is given below:


a) Sub Collectors, Local Roads and Residential Lanes Category P3


b) Principal and Collector Category V4 or P3


c) Arterial Category V3 or V2


d) Public Accessways Category P4


9.12.1.9 The streetlight design must be certified by a suitably qualified and experienced lighting
professional. This shall be endorsed on the plan.


9.12.1.10 Rural Road Flag Lights shall be installed as per clause 3.5 of AS/NZS 1158.1.1.


**9.12.2 Luminaires**


9.12.2.1 All new streetlights shall be solid state Light Emitting Diode (LED) type luminaires. Road
lighting spacing shall be designed to meet the requirements in AS/NZS 1158.


9.12.2.2 All luminaires must have a light distribution style with a UWLR (upward waste light ratio) of
less than 1%.


9.12.2.3 All luminaires shall have a tilt angle of 0-2.5deg, which has been set to achieve consistency
across the network and reduce unwanted light spill. This will reduce the likelihood of
luminaires being installed at a negative angle. A tilt angle variation may be accepted only on
approval of the Engineering Manager.


9.12.2.4 All new luminaires should be fitted with a 7-pin NEMA socket and a DALI compatible LED
driver. This is to future-proof for possible implementation of a streetlight Central Monitoring
System (CMS).


9.12.2.5 All lighting designs must be submitted to the Council for approval.


9.12.2.6 In relation to pedestrian crossings, lighting levels shall meet the requirements of
AS/NZS 1158.4.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 9 – Telecommunications, Electrical,

Streetlighting Page 14/18


9.12.2.7 All luminaires, in general, should be NZTA M30 approved.


9.12.2.8 For non-M30 approved luminaires, verification shall be by the supplier’s independent M30 test
criteria. Any such luminaires will also need to meet the Engineering Manager’s approval in
terms of expected whole-of-life cost. Whole-of-life costs are to be measured over a 20-30 year
period.


**9.12.3 Columns**


9.12.3.1 The specified intended life of new pole bases shall be 50 years unless otherwise approved by
the Council.


9.12.3.2 Columns and outreaches shall meet the requirements of the relevant AS/NZS standards:


a) AS/NZS 4065 – Concrete utility services poles;


b) AS/NZS 4677 – Steel utility services poles;


c) AS/NZS 4676 – Structural design requirements for utility services poles;


d) AS/NZS 4680 – Hot-dip galvanised (zinc) coatings on fabricated ferrous articles.


9.12.3.3 The outer surfaces of galvanised ground-planted columns and stub bases shall be protected
to 100mm above finished surface level (ground or concrete) and to the base of the column,
with a continuous self-priming, non-conductive barrier coating (epoxy-mastic or similar) at
least 350 micron thick.


9.12.3.4 All streetlight poles shall have installed at the pole door aperture an approved Streetlighting
Cut Out (SLCO) for connection of the incoming neutral screen cable(s) to the flexible cable
connection to the luminaire(s). All stripping back of cables to be contained within the body of
the SLCO.


9.12.3.5 Frangible (impact absorbing) type shall be used in high-risk crash locations, within the clear
zones in areas with a speed limit of 70kph and below.


9.12.3.6 Slip base type shall be used in high-risk crash locations, within the clear zones in areas with a
speed limit of 70kph and above.


9.12.3.7 Painting of lighting columns is generally not permitted, but if there is a particular reason for
doing so, approval shall be obtained from the Council.


9.12.3.8 The painting system to be used shall be the Resene paint system Altex Devoe or a similar
approved equivalent. The following methods shall apply:


a) Devthan 379 (previously named E-line 939) used in all exposed marine environments


b) E-line 929 used in all other locations


c) Any new paint system will require a 10-year workmanship warranty from supplier.


9.12.3.9 The painting system shall be applied over galvanised poles which meet hot dip galvanised
standard AS/NZS 4680. (Note: this requires galvanising both inside and outside the pole.)


9.12.3.10 If an adjacent property has not been developed (for example, a new subdivision) and the pole

cannot be positioned in line with the common boundary, locate the pole at least 5m from the
boundary to allow for a future vehicle entrance.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 – Chapter 9 – Telecommunication, Electrical and

Streetlighting Page 15/18


9.12.3.11 Position poles at least 1m away from a vehicle entrance or kerb cutdown. Poles to be

positioned to provide clearance of at least 6m from any existing street or private tree canopy.
Note: where protected trees are present, large clearances may be necessary. Trees planted
as part of the subdivision landscaping are to comply with the above clearances.


9.12.3.12 Where installing a pole against the building line, ensure that it is installed on the legal road or

on the Council land and not on private property.


9.12.3.13 Regarding ownership, there are two regimes of underground cables within the Council areas.

These are as follows:


a) Nelson Electrical Ltd (NEL) area – All underground cables up to the fuse located in the

base of the streetlight pole and all overhead cables shall be scheduled as the property of
NEL. The cable from the fuse in the base of the streetlight pole up to the streetlight shall
be scheduled as the property of the Council.


b) Network Tasman (NWT) area – All lanterns, control circuits, underground cables (except

streetlight pilot cores in underground cables), relays and associated equipment up to but
not inside of NWT service boxes or padmount transformers shall be scheduled as the
property of the Council.


9.12.3.14 All unmetered lighting load connected to the line owners “works” must have prior approval

from the Line Owner. Any maintenance changes or new design details must include individual
site details, lamp wattages and losses and proposed livening dates. Once connected, the
livening date must be confirmed to the Line Owner within 48 hours, allowing the Line Owner
24 hours (pursuant to the Electricity Governance Rules) to enter details into the Electricity
Commission’s Registry. All work involving streetlights directly connected to the line owners
“works” may only be performed by persons with a Authorised Holders Certificate approved by
the respective line owner.


9.12.3.15 Prior to the issuing of the Section 224 Resource Management Act certification for new

subdivisions the developer must submit streetlighting as-built data, including GPS location of
all columns. This information shall be supplied on the street light data collection form.


9.12.3.16 Private street lighting on private roads or rights-of-way will only be permitted if the luminaires

are on a separate metered circuit and a charging agreement is set up with owners and a
power supply company. (Note: private streetlighting on any private right-of-ways in the
Network Tasman area are approved by Network Tasman. The Council has no involvement
with private streetlighting on private property).


9.12.3.17 The maintenance of private lights on private property will be the landowner’s responsibility.


9.12.3.18 The installation of privately owned road lights (owned by a power company or other private

company) are not permitted on public roads.


9.12.3.19 Amenity lighting that is lighting for decorative purposes that does not serve to provide lighting

for pedestrians, vehicles or direction signage is not permitted on legal road.


9.12.3.20 Regarding reserves lighting in Nelson City, lighting standards for neighbourhood parks shall

be the Salisbury Short with Cardiff Column or similar design as approved by the Council.

**CHAPTER 10** **PARKS AND RESERVES**


**INTRODUCTION**


**10 PURPOSE**


The purpose of this chapter is to outline the standards for the design and creation of reserves that are to be
vested in the Council. The aim is to achieve a high standard of accessibility, public health and safety, variety,
multifunctional use, and environmental value, whilst maintaining whole-of-life affordability.

Facilities Manager (Tasman District Council).


**10.1 Performance Outcomes**


Reserves are an important element of an urban neighbourhood or rural area. They provide opportunities for
recreation and social contact, and their spaciousness contrasts with built development. The way a subdivision
relates to public spaces such as roads, reserves, rivers and streams is very important for their usability,
amenity and public safety.

The performance outcomes for the design and creation of reserves and associated assets sought by these
standards are as follows:


a) Sufficient provision of reserves to meet levels of service for recreation, social contact, neighbourhood
amenity, access and natural values;


b) Variety of reserves throughout the City/District, such as neighbourhood parks, esplanade reserves,
walkways and playgrounds;


c) Highly accessible reserves for a range of users, including pedestrians and, cyclists;


d) Multifunctional reserves that can accommodate other functions or values where appropriate, such as
stormwater management, natural and cultural heritage protection, and walkways and cycleways;


e) Reserves that are affordable and accessible to operate and maintain;


f) Reserves that are safe for all users;


g) An interconnected network of reserves that maximises opportunities for urban greenways, walkways
and cycleways;


h) Reserves that are completed to a high standard of presentation prior to vesting in the Council; and


i) Reserves plantings that meet amenity, natural character, beautification (including colour), ease of
maintenance and efficiency values, whilst avoiding off-site effects.


**10.2 Referenced Documents**


**10.2.1** **Reserves Act 1977**

**STANDARDS**


**10.3 Design Purpose**


This chapter sets out the Councils’ expectations for the design of a reserve, based on its purpose, values,
character and users.

Nelson City and Tasman District Councils’ take, purchase and develop reserve land for the following
management purposes:

|NelsonCityCouncil|TasmanDistrictCouncil|
|---|---|
|Neighbourhood Parks|Urban Open Space and Amenity Reserves|
|Esplanade and Foreshore Reserves|Rural Recreation and Esplanade Reserves|
|Conservation and Landscape Reserves|Special Interest Sites|
|Sportsgrounds|Sportsgrounds|
|Public Gardens|Formal Gardens|
|Cemeteries|Cemeteries|
|Utility Reserves|Utility Reserves|
|Access|Walkways/Shared Paths|



The purposes of Esplanade and Foreshore Reserves, Rural Recreation and Esplanade Reserves are outlined
in section 229 and amendments of the Resource Management Act.


The purposes of Conservation and Landscape Reserves/Special Interest Sites are:


a) To protect and restore indigenous vegetation, habitats and ecosystems;


b) To protect archaeological and historic sites and values;


c) To maintain and restore natural landscape characteristics, especially those that form the Nelson city
and Richmond backdrop; and


d) To allow and encourage public use of the reserve.


The purpose of Neighbourhood Reserves is to provide accessible informal recreation close to home, primarily
for play and social interaction and enhancing the amenity of residential areas


The purpose of Sportsground Reserves/Sportsgrounds reserves under this chapter is to provide a range of
sportsgrounds that are accessible and meet the changing needs of residents. Sportsground
Reserves/Sportsgrounds are distributed throughout the Nelson and Tasman areas on large flat versatile sites.


The purpose of Public/Formal Gardens reserves is to provide a flagship role for the Nelson City and Tasman
District’s identity and heritage, by providing a number of reserves that highlight a wide range of horticulture,
plant collections and landscape features and styles.


The purpose of reserves for cemeteries is to provide cemeteries in a park-like setting that meet community
expectations and are consistent with the community’s beliefs, feelings and range of choices.


**Mandatory Matters**


The Council requires the following standards to be met for the intended purpose of any reserve:


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 10 – Parks and Reserves Page 3/20


**10.3.1** **General**


10.3.1.1 Gaps in neighbourhood park/reserve provision identified in the NRMP, TRMP, Parks and Reserves
Asset/Activity Management Plan or an indicative reserve is identified in a structure plan or outline
development plan (including the need to protect natural or archaeological features, linkages,
viewpoints or rest areas) must be used to assist in determining appropriate sites for reserves.


10.3.1.2 Prior to lodging subdivision applications, developers must undertake pre-application consultation
with the Major Projects Team and/or the Urban Design Panel in Nelson and the Manager, Lead
Overseer, relevant staff and the Urban Design panel where appropriate in Tasman. The purpose of
these discussions is to facilitate the integrated design of the reserve with the subdivision or
adjacent areas and ensure that urban design goals are met in the design of both private and public
spaces, and any areas for utility or transportation purposes.


10.3.1.3 The placement of utilities (including stormwater, water or sewerage pipes or power supply or
telecommunication lines) which may compromise future use of the reserve must be avoided
wherever possible.


10.3.1.4 If the placement of a utility within a reserve is unavoidable, a plan and reasons why the utility
cannot be located elsewhere must be submitted to the Manager for approval prior to confirming
their location.


10.3.1.5 No credit against reserve financial contributions will be given for land within Local Purpose (Utility)
Reserves below Q15 or esplanade reserves where the adjoining allotment is under four hectares.


10.3.1.6 A partial credit may be given for Local Purpose (Utility) Reserves above Q15 if the reserve is
requested to meet the Councils’ level of service for recreation or open space and the use of the
reserve for utility purposes does not compromise the recreation/open space function.


**10.3.2** **Process of Determining Design Purpose**


10.3.2.1 Following pre-application consultation with the Manager, the location and size of a reserve will be
included in the scheme plan submitted with the subdivision application. The vesting of the reserve,
its classification and any development requested by or agreed to be the Manager will be a
condition of the consent.


10.3.2.2 There is no requirement for a concept plan for the development of a reserve to be provided. The
reserve is required to be presented for vesting in accordance with these standards. Development of
the reserve will generally be undertaken following vesting and in consultation with the community.


**10.3.3** **Neighbourhood Parks/Open Space Amenity Reserves**


10.3.3.1 Must be located and designed so that they are connected with the existing roading network and
where possible, existing reserves, access ways and open spaces to provide routes and return
loops for recreational use, encourage sustainable transport choices by allowing for continuous offroad journeys and contribute to creating larger open space areas. Consideration should be given to
how the development will link to the surrounding landscape, including existing areas of open space,
and to other public areas, such as schools, town centres, community facilities or public transport


10.3.3.2 Must not be made of “left over” land, the location and design must be informed by the
neighbourhood context and the particular aspects of the site.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 10 – Parks and Reserves Page 4/20


10.3.3.3 Must be designed and presented in accordance with these standards prior to the application for
section 224(c) certificate approval.


10.3.3.4 Must at a minimum aim to have a total area of 2,500 m2 and a useable, flat area of 1,250 m2.


10.3.3.5 Land will only be vested as recreation reserve if it meets the neighbourhood reserve criteria.


10.3.3.6 The level of service for the location of Neighbourhood Parks in relation to residential properties in
Nelson City is determined in the Nelson City Council Parks and Reserves AMP.


10.3.3.7 The level of service for the location of Urban Open Space Amenity Reserves in relation to
residential and rural properties in Tasman District is determined in the Tasman District Council
Reserves and Facilities AMP.


10.3.3.8 Must be of an even and regular shape that allows for maximum usable space and ease of
maintenance.


10.3.3.9 Must be highly visible in order to maximise amenity, safety and open space benefits for the
surrounding community and to allow the reserves to be easily found by users, and meet the
following standards:


a) Have a minimum 30 metre road frontage on at least one side;


b) Be located on a through road, or connect two cu-de-sacs;


c) Have additional access points provided to connect to the road network within the subdivision

and adjoining areas;


d) Have access crossings provided for maintenance vehicles and equipment;


e) Be located and orientated to maximise daylight and sunlight hours;


f) Developed so as to reduce drafts, shading and cold;


g) Encourage neighbouring properties to have living spaces facing onto the reserve; and


h) Located to ensure that potential hazards to public safety (such as site stability or

contamination) do not exist or it is possible to remedy or mitigate any hazard.


10.3.3.10 Natural features or features of local and/or cultural interest or significance such as streams,

remnant native forest or specimen trees will be identified and included within the reserve where
appropriate and agreed to by the Manager.


10.3.3.11 Must not be used as a storage area or access to residential building sites by contractors.


**10.3.4** **Esplanade Reserves**


10.3.4.1 The circumstances, where reserves under this chapter must be provided or considered adjoining

Plans. The Council may seek to purchase additional areas to add to the environmental, amenity
and recreational value of the reserve network.


10.3.4.2 Paths on esplanade reserves must be provided where they are an integral part of a walking/cycling
connection within the subdivision or wider area.


10.3.4.3 Given the generally long and linear nature of these reserves, visibility and accessibility must be
maximised to enhance the amenity, safety and open space benefits for the surrounding community
and to allow them to be easily located.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 - Chapter 10 – Parks and Reserves Page 5/20


10.3.4.4 Coastal margins and river/stream banks will be presented in a stable and natural state. See section

maintenance access corridor) it must be vested as a Local Purpose Reserve at no cost to the
Council, integrated into the design of the development and enhanced with planting to provide for
environmental and amenity values.


10.3.7.2 Utility reserves adjoining waterways must incorporate any adjacent the Council-owned stormwater
detention or treatment infrastructure (such as detention ponds or constructed wetlands) and all
riparian habitats (including river banks, upper terraces and adjacent annual flood plains and natural
wetlands) plus adjacent areas of riparian vegetation. This will allow for integrated management of
the waterway environment.


10.3.7.3 The location and design of utility reserves must be subject to the approval of the Manager prior to
lodging an application for a subdivision consent.


10.3.7.4 Reserves and open space areas that also have stormwater management functions will be designed
in accordance with the Stormwater Chapter of the Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual
(NTLDM).


10.3.7.5 Must not have flooding or ponded stormwater for storm events up to and including a 15-year design
storm (Q15 or 6.6% AEP) in Nelson and Richmond and a 10-year design storm (Q10 or 15% AEP)
for the remainder of the Tasman District.


10.3.7.6 Must have a soil type/s, detention structure(s) and a water table so that flooding is no deeper than
200mm and any storm water drains away within 24 hours.

10.7.1.14 Developers must provide the Manager with written notice prior to the reserve being sown with

grass so an inspection can be undertaken. Written notice must also be provided a minimum of 2
months prior to the application for section 224(c) certificate approval for any stage of the
subdivision that includes a reserve to vest. Notice is required so inspections can be undertaken
and any remedial works required prior to the application for section 224(c) certificate.


10.7.1.15 Written notice from the Developer or the contractor undertaking the maintenance work must be

provided to the Manager at the end of the two-year maintenance period so ongoing maintenance or
other works can be provided for in the Councils’ work programme.

Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 – Appendix 1 – Legal TOC – Page i/i


**APPENDIX 1** **LEGAL**


**INTRODUCTION**

This appendix sets out Council’s expectations for a number of legal matters, such as liability, indemnity
and insurance, delegations, vesting, ownership and location of services. These are general requirements,
and should be read in conjunction with the asset-specific requirements of each chapter.


**1.1 Liability**


The following sets out matters of liability and responsibility for any works involving an asset that is vested
in or is to be vested in Council ownership.


- Council takes no responsibility for inaccurate information or unknown infrastructure found on site.


- Council will not be liable for any damages or loss whatsoever suffered from the use of information
held by Council.


- All contractors/consultants must undertake other (such that there is a duty) field investigations that
are necessary for surveyors/designers/owners etc to investigate fully/pothole to verify designs and
correct positions of services etc.


- The consent holders, their employees, contractors and agents are responsible for physically
locating the position of pipes and other utilities and infrastructure before commencing works.


**1.2 Indemnity**


All Designers or DPA’s must have current professional indemnity insurance for an amount not less than:






|Project|ProfessionalIndemnity|
|---|---|
|In-fill development, not more than six lots or dwellings,<br>no services vested to Council|$300,000|
|In-fill development, not more than six lots or dwellings,<br>and/or some services vested to Council|$1,000,000|
|Green field development, more than six lots or<br>dwellings where roads are vested to Council or<br>services of $500,000 or greater vested to Council|$2,000,000|



Any contractor/operator undertaking excavation and reinstatement works within any Council property will
hold public liability insurance for an amount not less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) for any claim or
series of claims arising out of the same occurrence.

Compliance with any instruction of Council, or any person acting on its behalf, in performing what is
considered to be necessary actions in terms of these standards will not absolve the contractor from any
legal liability that he would otherwise have had in regard to claims for damage or failure of work for the
client.

The Council will not be held liable for a loss of income due to construction works or loss of services while

Council’s contractors or agents work on programmed works.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 – Appendix 1 – Legal Page 1/4


**1.3 Excavation and Reinstatement works within legal road**


The contractor/operator will be held responsible for any street maintenance work required as a result of
the excavation and reinstatement operations until twenty-four (24) months after notification to the Council
that the final surfacing material has been applied.

Any such maintenance work required by Council will be undertaken by the operator at the operator's cost
within five (5) working days of being notified by the Council to undertake repair works. If on the grounds of
safety there is a need for more immediate action this remedial work will be completed within forty-eight
(48) hours or such other time as may be directed by the Council. Should this not be complied with,
Council reserves the right to arrange or undertake such maintenance work and this work will be at the
cost of the operator.

See Chapter 8, Earthworks, Trenching and Reinstatement for further details.

For infrastructure, the Developer will retain responsibility for addressing defects arising from poor
workmanship or faulty materials during a required maintenance period of at least 24 months following
completion of works.


**1.4 Performance Bonds**


The Developer will provide a performance bond for unknown construction or design defects in cash or
from a bondsman such as a registered bank (as defined in section 2 of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand
Act 1989) or insurance company or other approved company, and meet the following conditions:


- The bond will apply to all subdivision or development construction works involving three or more
additional lots or three new residential sites or where roads or services are to be vested in the

Council.


The bond for defects will be for the sum of $1,500 per lot or residential site from a minimum of
$5,000 to a maximum of $30,000 per stage, plus a bond administration fee of $150. For significant
infrastructure items that are to vest with council, an additional bond amount will be required. This
amount will be set by Council’s Engineering Manager.


- The term of the performance bond for defects liability will be for a minimum period of twenty-four
(24) months from the satisfactory completion of the works (for contracts), or the issue of a
224 certificate as required under the RMA. Note: a maximum term of five (5) years may be
imposed for low impact stormwater designs.


- The performance bond for defects will cover maintenance attributable to defects and the remedy of
all defects arising from defective workmanship or materials.


- This will cover the services and roading construction works that are to be vested in the Council and
other civil and structural engineering construction works to serve the subdivision or development
and including electrical supply and telecommunication cable systems.


- The Developer/consent holder will be liable for the remedy of all asset defects arising before the
end of the period of maintenance, together with Council costs in administering the bond. The
developer will not be liable for damage by third parties.


- In the event that such a defect arises the Developer will be advised and, provided that the remedial
work is not classified as urgent, given the opportunity to address the defect. Where urgent work is
required to maintain service or where work on a ‘live’ system is required it will be carried out by
Council’s contractor at the Developer’s cost.


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 – Appendix 1 – Legal Page 2/4


- The performance bond for defects will not be required to cover general earthworks but will be
required to cover any earthworks considered by Council to be part of the civil engineering
construction.


**1.5 Delegations**


The Council has the authority to enforce the provisions of the Land Development Manual and may
delegate such authority to any officer of Council or its nominated consultant.


**1.6 Location of Services**


This section deals with the location of services, and ownership responsibilities associated with all and any
part of the service on privately-owned land, or privately-owned services on Council-owned land.


**1.7 Services on Public Land**


All reticulation will be located in accordance with the following general requirements:


- The preferred location of services to be vested in Council is on Council-owned land;


- All services will be aligned in accordance with the requirements of each section of this document.


- All services will be easily accessible for maintenance and repair works, so as to minimise
disruption.


- Diagonal crossing of other services, including kerb lines and boundaries or fence lines, at acute
angles less than 45 degrees will be avoided wherever possible.


- A minimum of 200mm vertical separation distance to all other underground services is required.


- Specific approval from the Engineering Manager will be required for any private services to be
located within public land. Approval will be subject to a ‘licence-to-occupy’.


**1.8 Services on Private Land**


The preferred location of services is on public land. However, this cannot be achieved in all
circumstances, due to the location of existing infrastructure networks, land ownership and the topography
of the landscape.

The following matters guide the placement of services on private land:

Where services are to be located on private land, consideration will be given to:


- Preserving access to the pipelines for maintenance purposes;


- Preserving the route for relaying services in the future; and


- Avoiding likely positions for buildings, garages, carports and retaining walls.


The preferred alignments of piped reticulation on private property will be:


- Within rights-of-way (ROWs) or driveways;


- Outside probable building envelopes;


- Clear of fence lines and kerb lines;


- Clear of large trees or heavily vegetated areas;


- Adjacent to boundaries;


Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual; September 2020 Rev 1 – Appendix 1 – Legal Page 3/4


- Parallel to boundaries; and


- On the northern side of lots.


Where a public or private service is located on private land access for repairs and maintenance will be
maintained, and the following conditions met:


- An easement will be required in favour of the Council, where as part of a subdivision or
development proposal, public drains less than or equal to 300mm diameter will be located in
private property. The minimum width of easement will be 3.0m (Note: minimum 2.0 for rural water
supply systems over farm land) with the pipe placed central within the easement. For public drains
greater than 300mm diameter the minimum width of easement will be 3.0m plus the pipe diameter
(i.e. 1.5m either side of the pipe).


- The standard wording required on engineering plans in the “notes” section, will be: “Memorandum
of Easement in Gross will be provided in favour of Council to convey stormwater and/or wastewater
in a pipe and to provide unrestricted access along the line of the pipe for maintenance and renewal
work and to protect secondary flow paths”.


- Similar easements may be required over private common drains in favour of the lots served.


- Pipelines deeper than 2.5m will require easement widths greater than 3.0m plus pipe diameter to
allow for wider than normal trench widths needed to access the pipe in the future.


- Where any construction work is required on another property, the owner’s consent will be endorsed
on the original drawing in opaque black ink (not biro) that will permit satisfactory scanning
reproduction.
