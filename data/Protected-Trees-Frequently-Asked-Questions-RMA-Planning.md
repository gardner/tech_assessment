# **RMA Planning/Resource Consents** **PROTECTED TREES** **Frequently Asked Questions**






|FAQ Refer to the Nelson Resource Management Plan (NRMP) for rules in full|Rule|
|---|---|
|**What is a protected tree?**<br>A protected tree is one that is listed in the Nelson Resource Management Plan<br>(NRMP) as a ‘Heritage’ or ‘Landscape’ Tree. Heritage Trees are the most<br>significant trees in the district, and Landscape Trees are important, but of a<br>lesser priority. Resource consent is required for certain activities in relation to<br>protected trees, which cover three broad areas: significant pruning, removal,<br>and works in proximity to the tree. A third category, Local Trees, is also<br>included in the NRMP for recognition but does not receive any protection.|n/a|
|**How does a tree become protected?**<br>Trees are typically nominated for protection by members of the public, often<br>the owner of the property. The tree is assessed for significance using the<br>Standard Tree Evaluation Method (STEM), and then needs to be included in the<br>NRMP by way of a plan change. A plan change involves engagement with the<br>owner and others potentially affected, formal submissions and hearings.<br>Decisions on plan changes can be appealed to the Environment Court.|n/a|
|**Can I prune my protected tree?**<br>The level of pruning allowed depends on the category of the protected tree<br>(pruning of heritage trees is more restricted).<br>Providing the work is done in accordance with accepted arboricultural practice,<br>the following pruning is permitted (more significant works require resource<br>consent).<br>Permitted for Heritage Trees<br>_Crown cleaning_: the removal of dead, dying, diseased, crowded, weakly<br>attached, low vigour branches and water sprouts from a tree crown<br>_Canopy lifting_: the balanced removal of lower branches of a tree on road<br>reserve.<br>Permitted for Landscape trees<br>_Crown cleaning:_ the selective removal of branches to increase light penetration<br>and air movement through the crown where:<br>a)  no more than one-third of live foliage is to be removed, and<br>b)  after pruning at least half of the foliage is on the branches in the lower two-<br>thirds of the tree, and<br>c)  half of the foliage on laterals on the inner two-thirds of a branch is<br>retained,<br>provided that such removal shall not be used successively to incrementally<br>reduce the size of the tree, or to remove the tree.|REr.93<br>ICr.66<br>SCr.63<br>INr.65<br>OSr.68<br>RUr.68|

|FAQ Refer to the Nelson Resource Management Plan (NRMP) for rules in full|Rule|
|---|---|
|**Can I remove my protected tree?**<br>To remove a protected tree requires a resource consent. Consent may be<br>granted in some circumstances, for example if the tree presents a serious risk<br>to human life or property, renders a site incapable of reasonable use or places<br>an unfair and unreasonable burden on the owner.|REr.96<br>ICr.69<br>SCr.66<br>INr.68<br>OSr.71<br>RUr.71|
|**What can I do in close proximity to a protected tree?**<br>Certain activities require resource consent if carried out within an area<br>immediately around a protected tree called a Root Protection Zone (RPZ). The<br>exact RPZ varies from tree to tree, but is calculated by multiplying the tree’s<br>trunk diameter by a specific variable that depends on the tree’s age and vigour<br>(a value ranging from 6 to 15). Council’s Arboricultural Supervisor can advise<br>on a particular tree’s RPZ radius. The following activities need resource consent<br>within the RPZ:<br><br>Parking/storage of materials/vehicles/machinery on unsealed surfaces<br><br>compaction, sealing, removal or addition of soil<br><br>discharge of a toxic substance<br><br>excavation or construction of structures<br>Some exceptions exist for activities on existing sealed roads.|REr.95<br>ICr.68<br>SCr.65<br>INr.67<br>OSr.70<br>RUr.70|
|**Does council offer any assistance for owners of protected trees?**<br>Yes. Council provides assistance to owners of protected trees by offering a free<br>inspection and minor maintenance service e.g. removal of dead wood or minor<br>pruning. Any work that can’t be carried out as a permitted activity under the<br>NRMP rules is the responsibility of the owner.<br>In addition, reduced fee resource consents are available for trimming of<br>protected trees and there is no resource consent fee for applications to remove<br>a protected tree that is confirmed in writing by a qualified arborist (Level 5<br>NZQA or equivalent) as diseased or a threat to public safety.|n/a|
|**Who is responsible for a protected tree?**<br>Listing in the NRMP has no bearing on the ownership of a tree and ultimate<br>responsibility rests with the owner.<br>Under common law, if your tree overhangs a boundary then the neighbour may<br>trim it back to that boundary (bearing in mind this may require resource<br>consent if the tree is protected). The owner of the property the branches<br>overhang is responsible for costs associated with trimming on their side.<br>Regardless of protection, or whom a tree belongs to, if a tree falls and causes<br>damage it is generally the responsibly of the owner of the damaged property<br>(or their insurer) that takes responsibility for the repairs.<br>More information on rights and responsibilities in relation to trees in general is<br>available from various websites including Consumer NZ, the Citizen’s Advice<br>Bureau, Community Law and a range of insurance companies.|n/a|

_**FAQ to make decisions about your property.**_ Plan changes occur from time to time and this FAQ will be updated to
reflect the relevant changes as soon as is practicable. In addition to standards and consents required under the
Resource Management Act, the proposed activity may also need building consent, licences and permits under other

legislation such as the Building and Health Acts.
