**6.** **PART SIX - CONTROL OF ALCOHOL IN PUBLIC PLACES**


**Scope**


6.1 This part of the Bylaw controls the bringing of alcohol into specified public places

6.2 The Local Government (Alcohol Reform) Amendment Act 2012 defines a public

place as a place that is open to or is being used by the public, whether free or

on payment of a charge, and whether any owner or occupier of the place is

lawfully entitled to exclude or eject any person from it, but does not include any

licensed premises.


6.3 This definition enables the Council to consider whether there is any privately

owned land which is accessed by the public (such as a car park) for which there

are good reasons to restrict the drinking of alcohol. The control of alcohol bylaw

provisions do not apply to private residential properties.


**Prohibited Activities**


6.4 No person shall:

days before it shall take effect.


**Exceptions**


**Transport of Alcohol**


6.7 The Bylaw does not prohibit, in the case of alcohol in an unopened bottle or

other unopened container:


     The transport of that alcohol from premises that adjoin a public place

during any period when, under the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012, it

is lawful to sell alcohol on those premises for consumption off the

premises, provided the alcohol is promptly removed from the public place.


     The transport of that alcohol from outside a public place for delivery to

premises that adjoin the public place, provided the premises are licensed

for the sale of alcohol under the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012.


     The transport of alcohol from outside a public place to premises that adjoin

a public place:


A1334602 19


Nelson City Council Urban Environments Bylaw No. 225 –
June 2015


`o` by, or for delivery to, a resident of those premises or by his or her

visitors; or


`o` from those premises to a place outside the public place by a resident

of those premises, provided the alcohol is promptly removed from

the public place.


**Licensed Premises**


6.8 The bylaw does not prohibit the possession of, or consumption of, alcohol in any

public place, or part of a public place, where this is authorised by a licence

issued under the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012, or where BYO alcohol is

permitted by the organiser of any Council-approved function or event making

use of the public place.

**Council Permission**


6.10 Any person may apply to the Council for a permit for any low risk activity
involving a limited amount of alcohol that would be in breach of any prohibition
under section 6.4 of this Bylaw.


6.11 A Council permit for this activity may be granted by Council, the Chief Executive
of Council, or any Licensing Inspector appointed under section 197(1) of the Sale
and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012.


6.12 A permit granted in accordance with this section of the Bylaw may include
conditions related to the following matters to ensure that the activity remains low
risk with respect to minimising alcohol related harm:


(i) the date and time the exemption applies;


(ii) the person or number of persons that are required for running the activity

during the period the exemption applies;


(iii) the nature of the activity associated with the exemption;


(iv) the numbers of persons that may attend the event while the exemption

applies;


(v) what controls may be required to ensure anyone under the age of 18 will not

have access to alcohol at the activity;


(vi) how much alcohol will be available;


(vii) what host responsibility provisions will apply, including provision of food, low

or non-alcoholic drinks, and alternative transport options.

     - provide the person with a reasonable opportunity to remove the alcohol or

the vehicle, as the case may be, from the public place.


**Specific events**


6.15 Where the Council considers it appropriate for the safe and effectual holding in

any public place or part of a public place of any public event, function or

gathering, it may make a publicly notified resolution no less than 14 days before

period or periods, the bringing of alcohol into the specified public place

during that period or periods, and the possession of alcohol in the specified

any way with the alleged offence.


**Obstruction of Enforcement Officer**


6.18 Every person who intentionally refuses to give their name and address when

requested to do so by an Enforcement Officer or member of the Police, or

knowingly misstates or provides false information, commits an offence against

section 229 of the Local Government Act 2002 and is liable on summary

conviction to the penalty specified in section 242(2) of the Act.


**Breach of alcohol-related bylaw provisions and penalty**
