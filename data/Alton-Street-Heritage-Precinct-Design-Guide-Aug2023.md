## **Introduction**

#### **DI1 Why a Design Guide?**

The Council, in the development of the Nelson Resource Management Plan (the
Plan), has identified particular residential areas which it considers merit
protection as Heritage Precincts.


The Heritage Precinct recognises that the whole is greater than the sum of the
parts; that a collection of Heritage Buildings, in context, has a greater impact on
the observer and the resident, and has greater heritage value than the same
number of buildings scattered throughout the city. The loss or the
unsympathetic alteration to even a single building detracts from the whole
Precinct rather like a missing tooth from a smile.


An important role of the Guidelines will be educational - to raise the awareness
of the residents and possible developers of the special nature of this Precinct, and
the impact on the street of alterations undertaken on a single building.


The Guide shall ensure that alterations to existing buildings, and new buildings
in the Precinct, are sensitive and enhance the existing visual qualities of the

streetscape.

#### **DI2 General Objectives of the Design Guidelines**


a) To identify the essential heritage values of each Precinct.


b) To set out ways in which these values can be protected and enhanced.


c) To provide education and information for building owners contemplating
changes to their property.


d) To help develop city-wide recognition of the value of these areas to the
Nelson community.

#### **DI3 How the Design Guidelines Operate**


The Design Guidelines operate on three levels:


i) They give a simple description of the history, the visual characteristics and
the special nature of the Precinct, thereby promoting residents’ and the
public’s awareness of, and sensitivity to, our heritage contained within the

Precinct.


ii) Owners and designers will find them a useful reference for preparing
sympathetic designs for new buildings or building alterations.


iii)  In reviewing development proposals the Nelson City Council will use the

Design Guidelines as a measure of how well the intended design fits the
objectives and policies of the Nelson Resource Management Plan.


Buildings within the Precinct will need to meet the requirements of the Plan.
Note in particular the rules in Chapter 7 relating to Heritage Precincts and the

demolition or removal of houses.


The Design Guidelines deal with three different situations:


a) new buildings, including houses;


b) alterations and additions to non-listed buildings; and


c) alterations and additions to listed Heritage Buildings (ie. heritage buildings
listed in the Plan, Appendix 1).


The Guidelines are concerned primarily with the streetscape and the appearance
of the buildings from the street.


The street elevation is obviously part of the streetscape, however the significance
of the side walls and roof to the streetscape depend on such issues as the distance
between houses and the height of a house in relation to its neighbours. This will
be assessed by Council staff on an individual basis. Interior alterations or
additions at the rear, or private areas of dwellings, which cannot be seen from
the street are not covered by the Guidelines.

#### **DI4 Area covered by the Design Guidelines**


A map showing the extent of the Precinct is attached at the end of the
Performance Guidelines, along with a table which identifies the listed Heritage
Buildings.


All houses in the Alton Street Heritage Precinct are listed Heritage Buildings.

#### **AS1 Historical Context**

The six houses contained within the Alton Street Precinct comprise a range of
styles including the villa, bungalow and transitional bungalow. The houses were
built circa 1900-1925 and are all good examples of their style.


The houses are grouped on the east side of Alton Street in a cul-de-sac with an
attractive landscaped median strip down the centre of the street, and a back drop
of large linden trees in Central School, all contributing to an important

streetscape.

#### **AS2 Objectives**


The key design objectives within the Alton Street Precinct are:


a)  to maintain the existing houses and encourage the restoration of the street

frontages.


b)  to ensure alterations and additions maintain the architectural integrity of

the listed Heritage Buildings.


c) to ensure that the design of new buildings is sympathetic to the
neighbouring houses and the streetscape so that the visual qualities of the
Precinct are enhanced.

#### **AS3 Visual Characteristics**


AS3.1 Height


The street consists of single storey houses except for the house on the corner
which is two storey. The low scale is an important feature of the street and needs
to be preserved.


AS3.2 Closeness to the Street


The houses are close to the street and also close to one another, presenting a
coherent elevation to the street. This is an important feature which helps to give
the street intimacy and a strong feeling of community.

**Design Guide** **August 2023**


AS3.3 Verandahs


The houses generally have verandahs facing onto the street. These are an
important feature of the houses and provide the transition space between the
public street and private home. Residents are encouraged to maintain the
verandahs.


AS3.4 Garaging


Existing garages, where provided, are generally at the side or rear of the site.
This allows the streetscape to maintain the strong continuous facade.


AS3.5 Fencing


The intimacy of the street depends upon the openness of the houses to the street.
The original low fences are ideal for this purpose, gently defining the boundary
but maintaining openness. High fences are inappropriate. Materials should be
sympathetic to the houses.


AS3.6 Materials and Detailing


Timber weatherboards and corrugated iron roofing are the original materials
used on the houses in the street, and are very much part of the character of the
houses.


Strong emphasis must be placed on the use of materials and detailing that is
sympathetic to the original design.


AS3.7 Windows and Doors


The window and door design, shape and proportion are
important elements in the design of the houses with the
frames and surrounds creating depth to the facade, detail
and a shadow line around the openings. Inappropriate
replacement windows can destroy the facade.


New houses should maintain similar proportions, and
level of detail and depth with their windows, to link them
with the existing housing.

#### **AS4 Performance Guidelines**


AS4.1 Listed Heritage Buildings


The listed Heritage Buildings are important elements in the Precinct. They shall
be retained and their values preserved, and:


a) demolition or removal of group A and B Heritage Buildings requires a
resource consent under the Nelson Resource Management Plan;


b) additions or alterations which impact on the streetscape shall maintain the
single storey nature of the streetscape although a first floor within the roof
space shall be allowed where it does not penetrate the roof envelope when
viewed from the street. The corner site may be two storey; and


c) additions or alterations which impact on the streetscape shall continue the
use of timber weatherboards, corrugated roofing, timber joinery and
detailing all to match the original. Windows should match the original in
shape, size and proportion.

AS4.2 Non-listed Buildings


Alterations and additions which impact on the streetscape shall enhance the
building and be in keeping with the Heritage Precinct. They shall:


**a)** maintain the single storey nature of the streetscape although a first
floor within the roof space shall be allowed where it does not penetrate
the roof envelope when viewed from the street


**b)** use timber windows and doors with detailing to match the existing
houses for windows seen from the street, and


**c)** use timber weatherboards and corrugated roofing to match existing
houses when seen from the street.


AS4.3 New Buildings


New buildings shall be designed in such a way as to enhance, complement and
be sympathetic to the existing streetscape, and:


a) the form and scale of the new work shall be in keeping with the existing
houses;


b) aluminium window joinery may be used on windows which are viewed
from the street but the proportions must be in keeping with the Precinct
incorporating similar depth and level of detail;


c) materials used on new work may differ from the listed Heritage Buildings,
however the designer shall select materials that complement and enhance
the values of the Precinct;


d) shall maintain the single storey nature of the street although a first floor
within the roof space shall be allowed where it does not penetrate the roof
envelope when viewed from the street. The corner site may be two storey;


e) the addition of verandahs is encouraged; and


f) roof lines shall follow the form of existing houses.


AS4.4 Garages


Garages are permitted in the front yard only when it is not reasonably practical
to provide a garage at the rear or side. Garages shall be designed to be
complementary to the streetscape in form, detail and use of materials.


AS4.5 Fences


Painted timber pickets or wrought iron are recommended as materials for new
fences, to a maximum height of 900mm from ground level. However solid fences
are permitted up to 1200mm in height, provided that any portion between 1200
to 1800mm above ground level is an open structure such as trellis, picket or
wrought iron.

## **planning** **applications**

#### **PA1 Application of the Nelson Resource Management** **Plan**

The following activities are permitted (no resource consent is required):


Interior alterations to any building within the Heritage Precinct (unless
otherwise specified in Appendix 1 Heritage Buildings, Places and Objects).


Exterior alterations to any part of a building within the Heritage Precinct visible
from an adjoining street or public space, if:


a) the work is redecoration, restoration or insignificant alteration of any
existing fabric or detailing; and


b) it is carried out to the same scale as the original, including window scale,
and with materials and details similar to, or having the same appearance
to those originally used.


The following activities require a resource consent application:


a) all new buildings; and


b) exterior alterations to any part of an existing building within the Heritage
Precinct which are visible from an adjoining street or public space, if the
work is not a permitted activity according to the definition above.


The consent application will be a Restricted Discretionary Activity. Such
applications will be non-notified, ie. considered without notification.


The Council’s assessment of the application will be based on:


i) compliance with the Design Guide for the Precinct.


ii) any effects (both positive and adverse) on the heritage values of the entire
Heritage Precinct.


iii) any cumulative or precedent effects on the values of the Precinct.


Note that a resource consent application is also required for the removal of an
unreinforced masonry chimney, a customer connection from a network utility,
or a sustainability addition, where permitted standards are not met (refer to the
Heritage Precinct rules in Chapter 7 of the Plan). A resource consent application
is also required for any proposal to demolish or remove a house within the
Precinct (see PA3 below).

#### **PA2 Consultation**


Early consultation with the Nelson City Council Planning Department is
encouraged to resolve design issues prior to lodging a resource consent
application. Consultation should begin at the commencement of design.

**August 2023** **Design Guide**


#### **PA3 Demolition or removal of Buildings**

The Nelson Resource Management Plan should be consulted if demolition or
removal of any house in the Precinct is contemplated, whether or not it is a listed
Heritage Building.


Any application for consent to demolish or remove must satisfy the tests in the
Plan. In addition, any demolition or removal application must be accompanied
by a resource consent application for the intended replacement building.

#### **PA4 Supporting information required**


Resource consent applications for any building development shall include:


a) the street elevation of the building, extended to show the elevations of the
buildings on either side.


b) a written analysis of the manner in which the proposed development
responds to the Design Guide and how it relates to the heritage values of
the Precinct.
