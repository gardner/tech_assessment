## **Introduction**

#### **DI1 Why a Design Guide?**

The Council, in the development of the Nelson Resource Management Plan (the
Plan), has identified particular residential areas which it considers merit
protection as Heritage Precincts.


The Heritage Precinct recognises that the whole is greater than the sum of the
parts; that a collection of Heritage Buildings, in context, has a greater impact on
the observer and the resident, and has greater heritage value than the same
number of buildings scattered throughout the city. The loss or the
unsympathetic alteration to even a single building detracts from the whole
Precinct rather like a missing tooth from a smile.


An important role of the Guidelines will be educational - to raise the awareness
of the residents and possible developers of the special nature of this Precinct, and
the impact on the street of alterations undertaken on a single building.


The Guide shall ensure that alterations to existing buildings, and new buildings
in the Precinct, are sensitive and enhance the existing visual qualities of the

streetscape.

#### **DI2 General Objectives of the Design Guidelines**


a) To identify the essential heritage values of each Precinct.
b) To set out ways in which these values can be protected and enhanced.
c) To provide education and information for building owners contemplating
changes to their property.
d) To help develop city-wide recognition of the value of these areas to the
Nelson community.

#### **DI3 How the Design Guidelines Operate**


The Design Guidelines operate on three levels:


i) They give a simple description of the history, the visual characteristics and
the special nature of the Precinct, thereby promoting residents’ and the
public’s awareness of, and sensitivity to, our heritage contained within the

Precinct.


ii) Owners and designers will find them a useful reference for preparing
sympathetic designs for new buildings or building alterations.


iii)  In reviewing development proposals the Nelson City Council will use the

Design Guidelines as a measure of how well the intended design fits the
objectives and policies of the Nelson Resource Management Plan.


Buildings within the Precinct will need to meet the requirements of the Plan.


**South Street** **Nelson City Council** **3**
**Design Guide** **August 2023**


Note in particular the rules in Chapter 7 relating to Heritage Precincts and the
demolition or removal of houses.


The Design Guidelines deal with three different situations:


a) new buildings, including houses;
b) alterations and additions to non-listed buildings; and
c) alterations and additions to listed Heritage Buildings (ie. heritage buildings
listed in the Plan, Appendix 1).


The Guidelines are concerned primarily with the streetscape and the appearance
of the buildings from the street.


The street elevation is obviously part of the streetscape, however the significance
of the side walls and roof to the streetscape depend on such issues as the distance
between houses and the height of a house in relation to its neighbours. This will
be assessed by Council staff on an individual basis. Interior alterations or
additions at the rear, or private areas of dwellings, which cannot be seen from
the street are not covered by the Guidelines.

#### **DI4 Area covered by the Design Guidelines**


A map showing the extent of the Precinct is attached at the end of the
Performance Guidelines, along with a table which identifies the listed Heritage
Buildings.


The Precinct includes non-listed buildings where these form an integral part of
the visual catchment. The aim, over time, is to achieve more sympathetic
development on non-listed sites as these are altered or rebuilt.

#### **SS1 Historical Context**

A detailed account of the history of South Street is contained in the books Town
Acre 456; Nelson, New Zealand; Historic South Street 1851-1988 by Jeannie
White, and “Windows on the Past” by Jeannie White and Phillip Edwards.


South Street contains a collection of cottages and houses built in the period 18601900. In 1981 the Council recognised the value of South Street and created a
special zone in its Review of the Nelson District Scheme.


Since then the street has been transformed with the removal of overhead wires
and their placement underground, cobblestone footpaths, and the restoration of
several houses.


All the buildings except Nos 8 and 12 Nile Street, and Nos 2 and 13a South Street
are listed Heritage Buildings.

#### **SS2 Objectives**


The key design objectives within the South Street Precinct are:


a) to maintain the listed Heritage Buildings and encourage the restoration of
the street frontage; and
b) to ensure that where an existing house has to be demolished the new house
is built in a style to match the existing dwellings when viewed from the

street.

#### **SS3 Visual characteristics**


SS3.1 Height


The houses are single storey except for those fronting Nile Street, the two
houses at the end of the street, and Nos 2 and 4. This is important as one of the
main features of the street is the small scale of the houses.


SS3.2 Closeness to the Street


The existing houses are built right onto the street boundary. This gives the street
its wonderful character and is a very important feature.


SS3.3 Garaging


Existing garages, where provided, are at the rear of the site. This allows the
streetscape to maintain a strong continuous facade. Garaging in the front yards
is not appropriate.

**Design Guide** **August 2023**


SS3.4 Fencing


The intimacy of the street depends upon the openness of the houses to the street.
Where fences are necessary, low timber picket-style fences are ideal as they
define the boundary but maintain openness. High fences are totally
inappropriate. Materials should be sympathetic to the houses.


SS3.5 Materials and detailing


The houses are generally simple buildings clad with timber weatherboards and
either corrugated iron or timber shingle roofing. The joinery is timber with
simple clean detailing.


Owners have added window boxes which are an attractive addition.


There are several fine examples in the street of restored houses where owners
have taken great care to ensure that all materials and details match the existing.


SS3.6 Windows and Doors


The window and door design, shape and proportion are
important elements in the street elevation. The timber frames
and surrounds create a three dimensional effect, an important
feature in the design of the houses.

#### **SS4 Performance guidelines**


SS4.1 Listed Heritage Buildings


The listed Heritage Buildings are important elements in the Precinct. They shall
be retained and their values preserved, and:


a) demolition or removal of group A and B Heritage Buildings requires a
resource consent under the Nelson Resource Management Plan;


b) additions or alterations which impact on the streetscape shall continue the
use of timber weatherboards, corrugated roofing or wooden shingles,
timber joinery and detailing all to match the original; and


c) additions or alterations are to maintain the single storey nature of the
street with roofs matching existing heights and pitch when viewed from
the street.


SS4.2 Non-listed buildings


Demolition or removal of non-listed houses in the Heritage Precinct requires a
resource consent under the Nelson Resource Management Plan.


Alterations and additions which impact on the streetscape shall enhance the
existing building and be in keeping with the Precinct. Wall and roofs which can
be seen from the street shall have:


a) timber windows and doors with detailing to match the existing houses
when seen from the street; and


b) timber weatherboards, corrugated roofing or timber shingles to match
existing houses.


SS4.3 New buildings


a) shall be designed to replicate the appearance of the existing houses from
the street;


**6** **Nelson City Council** **South Street**
**August 2023** **Design Guide**


b) the front of a new building shall line up with the existing houses to ensure
the continuous line of houses is maintained; and


c) the single storey nature of the houses shall be maintained with roofs
matching existing heights and pitch when viewed from the street.


SS4.4 Garages


Garages are not permitted in the front yard. Garages in the side yards shall be
designed to match the existing house in form, details and use of materials when
viewed from the street.


SS4.5 Fences


New fences on street frontages shall be timber picket fences, a maximum of 900
mm in height from footpath level.

## **planning** **applications**

#### **PA1 Application of the Nelson Resource Management** **Plan**

The following activities are permitted (no resource consent is required):


Interior alterations to any building within the Heritage Precinct (unless
otherwise specified in Appendix 1 Heritage Buildings, Places and Objects).


Exterior alterations to any part of a building visible from a street or public space
within the Heritage Precinct, if:


a) the work is redecoration, restoration or insignificant alteration of any
existing fabric or detailing; and
b) it is carried out to the same scale as the original, including window scale,
and with materials and details similar to, or having the same appearance
to those originally used.


The following activities require a resource consent application:


a) all new buildings; and
b) exterior alterations to any part of an existing building which are visible
from a street or public space within the Heritage Precinct, if the work is
not a permitted activity according to the definition above.


The consent application will be a Restricted Discretionary Activity. Such
applications will be non-notified, ie. considered without notification.


The Council’s assessment of the application will be based on:


i) compliance with the Design Guide for the Precinct.
ii) any effects (both positive and adverse) on the heritage values of the entire
Heritage Precinct.
iii) any cumulative or precedent effects on the values of the Precinct.


Note that a resource consent application is also required for the removal of an
unreinforced masonry chimney, a customer connection from a network utility,
or a sustainability addition, where permitted standards are not met (refer to the
Heritage Precinct rules in Chapter 7 of the Plan). A resource consent application
is also required for any proposal to demolish or remove a house within the
Precinct (see PA3 below).

#### **PA2 Consultation**


Early consultation with the Nelson City Council Planning Department is
encouraged to resolve design issues prior to lodging a resource consent
application. Consultation should begin at the commencement of design.

**Design Guide** **August 2023**


#### **PA3 Demolition or removal of Buildings**

The Nelson Resource Management Plan should be consulted if demolition or
removal of any house in the Precinct is contemplated, whether or not it is a listed
Heritage Building. Any application for consent to demolish or remove must
satisfy the tests in the Plan.


In addition, any demolition or removal application must be accompanied by a
resource consent application for the intended replacement building.

#### **PA4 Supporting information required**


Resource consent applications for any building development shall include:


a) the street elevation of the building, extended to show the elevations of the
buildings on either side.
b) a written analysis of the manner in which the proposed development
responds to the Design Guide and how it relates to the heritage values of
the Precinct.
