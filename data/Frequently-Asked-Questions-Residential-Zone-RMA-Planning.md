### **Frequently Asked Questions**



**How close to the boundary can I build?**

Road boundary setback – buildings* (including the eaves and
gutters) must be set back at least 1.5m from the road
boundary.

Side or rear boundary setback - buildings (including the eaves
and gutters) must be set back at least 1.5m from a side or rear
boundary if the total length of buildings along that boundary
exceeds 12m.

There are also daylight admission rules that may influence how
close to the boundary you can build.

*Note – “buildings” mean any structure made by people that is
fixed to land whether temporary or permanent or moveable. For
example a container counts as a building if it is fixed to the
ground.

Please also note there are rules relating to how close you can
build to drains and water mains.


**Where can I build a garage on my section?**

If within the front yard (the first 4m from the road boundary)
any garage, carport or accessory building must be set back at
least 1m further from the road boundary than the wall of the
house that faces the road.

There are also daylight admission rules that may influence how
close to the boundary you can build.

**How high can I build my fence?**

How high you can build a fence depends on where it is located.
The following table shows the permitted height for fences along
a boundary:











|Maximu<br>mHeight|Visualpermeability|WherecanIbuildit?|
|---|---|---|
|1.2m|No restrictions|Any boundary|
|1.8m|Entirely visually<br>permeable|Boundary (or within front yard)<br>of an ‘unclassified’ road|
|1.8m|Entirely visually<br>permeable|Boundary with a public space<br>(e.g. a reserve)|
|1.8m|At least 50% across the<br>entire front boundary<br>is visually permeable|Boundary (or within front yard)<br>of a ‘classified’ road|
|1.8m|No restrictions|Any otherproperty boundary|


Refer also to the **Residential Fences** brochure for definitions

and further information.


**How much of my property can I cover with building(s)?**

This depends where within the Residential Zone the site is
located. _Building coverage_ - of the _net area_ [†] of any site must not
exceed:

30% in the _Lower Density Area_ or _Lower Density Area (Stoke)_

60% in the _South St Heritage Precinct_

40% in the remainder of Residential Zone (including Higher
Density Area).


- Building coverage can include other areas i.e. the area for

required off-street car parking spaces which is not covered by
buildings.

- Net area excludes some areas i.e. access to a rear site.


**What can I do about my neighbour's proposed building**
**blocking my view?**

Generally, the planning rules in the NRMP do not control loss of
view. The maximum height for buildings is 7.5m.

**Can I subdivide my property?**

All subdivision and boundary adjustments require resource
consent. If minimum standards are met (e.g. each allotment has
a net area of at least 400m² in the standard residential zone),
Council will grant the resource consent subject to conditions to
ensure the site is adequately serviced and ready for further
development.


**Can I convert part of my house into a granny flat?**

A second residential unit must comply with all the zone rules. In
the standard residential zone 400m² must be allocated
exclusively to each residential unit. Parking and vehicle
manoeuvring requirements must also be met for each unit.


**Can I relocate my driveway?**

A Vehicle Access Alteration is required - the application form can
be found at the Nelson City Council website or customer services
centre. An approved installer is required to undertake the work.
The minimum distance between vehicle crossings must be 7.5m.
Other minimum standards apply for the new crossing, including
sufficient sight distances (visibility splay).


**Can I run a business from home?**

Yes. A business carried out on a residentially zoned site is
known in the NRMP as a _home occupation_ . This is permitted
providing a number of conditions are met. These include
conditions relating to the continuing residential use of the site,
the number of others involved in the activity, the effect of the
activity on residential amenity, the visibility of the activity and
vehicle use. The rule also includes a list of activities that are not
permitted as home occupations.


**Can I rent out my house as a holiday home?**

As long as you are still living in the house you can have up to
four holiday makers stay as well. Otherwise the activity will be
classed as a commercial or non-residential activity and requires
resource consent.

consent.


**I'm thinking of buying a heritage building - what are the**
**restrictions?**

Only redecoration or restoration resulting in the similar
appearance to the original building can be carried out without
resource consent. Alterations, new buildings on the property or
demolition activities will require resource consent from the
Council and approval from NZ Historic Places Trust.

Note: demolition of buildings listed as Category C items do not
require a resource consent provided two months written notice
is given to the Council prior to the work being done.


**What level of earthworks can I do without resource**

**consent?**

Filling or excavation up to 1.2m in vertical height or depth is
permitted. Over this height and up to 3m, the fill or excavation
must be immediately retained by a structure (with building
consent approval) and any excavation must be at least its
vertical depth away from a property boundary. All soil must be
managed so that there are no adverse effects on adjoining
properties or waterways.


**Can I install or replace an open fire or wood burner?**

New installations of open fires or wood burners are prohibited.
Installation of a pellet burner is permitted.


A wood burner that was authorised by the Council may be
replaced with a Council approved ‘clean air’ burner.

and building code) relating to buildings and residential activities
apply to the caravan.

If it is not fixed to the land the caravan must be at least 4m set
back from the road boundary and at least 1.5 m from other
boundaries. Occupants must use the toilet and cooking facilities
of the house and only live in the caravan for up to 50 days in

beyond your property boundary and no garden or household
waste is burnt.

Plan changes occur from time to time and this FAQ will be updated to reflect the
relevant changes as soon as is practicable. In addition to standards and consents

required under the Resource Management Act, the proposed activity may also need

building consent, licences and permits under other legislation such as the Building
