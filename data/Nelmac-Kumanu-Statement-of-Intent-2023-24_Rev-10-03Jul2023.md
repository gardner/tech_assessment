**Nelmac Kūmānu’s overarching**
**Strategic Pillars are:**


- Improve our core

- Protect & Develop our People

- Enhance our Environment


**4.1 Divisional Strategies**


Each Nelmac Kūmānu Division is guided by

achievements and progress toward the
overall company objectives:

environment

opportunities and leveraging of our core
competencies

technology which enables smart
programming of work, proof of service,
data integration with client systems, and
seamless dashboard style reporting


**4.2 Asset Management and Capital**
**Expenditure Strategy**


Nelmac Kūmānu’s capital assets play a
fundamental role in enabling our strategic
growth, maintaining profitability and
continuous improvement in service quality
and efficiency.


Our asset management strategy drives our
efforts to manage, maintain and maximise
the life and productivity of our capital
assets – plant, fleet and depots. Our capital
expenditure strategy includes:


1. an ongoing process to prioritise new
assets to sustain and grow our business in
the immediate and near future;

2. a systematic financial evaluation for
each significant new investment; and


3. instigating the review of major assets as
to whether they are fit for purpose (for
service delivery and health and safety).


1511110536-735


**4.3 Health and Safety**


Prioritising Health and Safety is a key focus.
We are continually refining our response
to workplace safety events supported by a
significant emphasis on staff engagement,
together with responding to trends identified
by our lead indicators.


Health and safety is a primary agenda item
for the Board of Directors and management
at each monthly meeting. In addition, critical
risk incident information is reviewed by the
Board as well as any findings and corrective
actions from Nelmac Kūmānu Incident Cause
Analysis Method (ICAM) investigations.


Nelmac Kūmānu has adopted Bow-tie
training through the company’s Leadership
Development Programme. Bow-tie is a risk
assessment tool which enables Nelmac
to identify critical risks and put in place
effective controls for risk mitigation.


The journey towards Zero Harm is ongoing
and at the forefront of operations across the

company.



Nelmac Kūmānu has developed and
implemented a set of 7 golden rules, listed
below, which guide staff behaviours relating
to our critical risks.


**7 Golden Rules of Safety**

1. Confined Spaces - I will have a permit
before entering confined space.
2. Energy/Pressurisation - I will verify that
hazardous energy is isolated.
3. Hazardous Substances - I will only handle
substances I am authorised to.
4. Heights - I will use fall protection when
working at heights.
5. Plant & Equipment - I will only use plant
and equipment I am competent with.
6. Traffic - I will be 100% focused when
driving or working next to moving
vehicles or plant.
7. Working Alone - I will let someone know
where I am.


One of Nelmac Kūmānu’s key safety
indicators is Total Recordable Injury
Frequency Rate (TRIFR). We set the 2023
target of reducing TRIFR from 12 to under 10.

1511110536-735

process which permeates all aspects of the
business including:

excellence, sustainability, change and
project management, plus operational
delivery including health and safety.

event of any potential civil emergency
caused by storm, pandemic, earthquake,

Management and Recovery Plan which
includes the following elements: Business

**6.4 Capital Programme**


Nelmac Kūmānu will continue to make appropriate investments in fleet and plant, while
balancing financial stability and meeting dividend policy.

Nelmac Kūmānu recognises the need to renew fleet and plant to deliver best possible Health &
Safety and Quality outcomes as well as to achieve Carbon Reduction targets.


Nelmac Kūmānu intends to invest at a rate greater than current depreciation and retained
earnings in order to achieve these outcomes. This additional investment will be funded by bank
debt.


In terms of land & buildings owned by Nelmac Kūmānu, the existing roof at 2 Bullen Street is
planned for replacement within the next 18 months. External specialist reports have confirmed
that the roof structure includes asbestos containing materials.


Nelmac Kūmānu is committed to the highest standards of Health & Safety. A number of
practicable steps have already been taken to address this. An asbestos management plan is in
place and subject to regular review. Ultimately, however, the roof will require replacement.


Previous capital management plans had the cost of replacement included in the plan. With
the changes to the forecasted Financial Performance, it requires Nelmac Kūmānu to explore
alternative options for funding the replacement of the roof, with an objective to establishing with
NCC a future recapitalisation plan, that will be available for review with NCC by December
2023.
