_interfering with the flora and fauna in an area, and obstructing or threatening an_
_enforcement officer. Section 22 of the Act sets out defences to a freedom camping_
_offence. The defences include that an offence was committed due to an action or_
_event beyond the control of the defendant that could not reasonably have been_
_foreseen, or the act was necessary to protect life or health, prevent injury or serious_
_damage to property. Council officers use their discretion when investigating freedom_
_camping complaints, which will include consideration of any defences that may be_
_available to a person._
