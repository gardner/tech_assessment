##### **INTRODUCTION**

Nelson has a long history of nurturing
unique creative endeavours that have
grown into iconic events loved by many,
such as the Masked Parade, World of
WearableArts, and Adam Chamber

Music Festival.


Events are important for community wellbeing, as they
build feelings of belonging, identity and a sense of pride
in our city as well as helping to grow awareness of our
diverse community.


They are also an increasingly important economic
contributor, growing the visitor market and helping
make Nelson an attractive destination for new residents.

They provide a valuable opportunity to showcase the
unique and compelling identity of the region and the
extraordinary city experience that Nelson is.


This Strategy is an expression of Council’s commitment to
developing the city’s events offering and sets out a vision,
objectives and criteria for publicly funded support.

employment opportunities. But
they also have a role in showcasing
Nelson through media coverage
and positive word of mouth
recommendations, as well as

encouraging return visits. They are
part of promoting an interesting
and vibrant lifestyle which benefits

residents and makes Nelson an

appealing place to settle.


Council funding and promotion
helps make events accessible to the
community.




#### **BENEFITS**

Community wellbeing is strengthened through an
inclusive and diverse events offering that brings
people together to enjoy a shared experience. The
affirmation of Nelson’s distinct creative, cultural

and recreational identity strengthens social bonds
as feelings of connection and belonging are
fostered and the region’s uniqueness is reinforced.



Community focused events are
important because they celebrate
our diverse local community and
can help our residents discover new
experiences and ideas and also
support broader objectives such
as healthy lifestyles and positive
wellbeing. Residents also benefit
from an improved level of facilities
that use by events helps to fund.


Events can attract visitors to stay,
eat, drink and shop in our city, boost
the local economy and increase

#### **PARTNERSHIP**

Ensuring Nelson continues to develop a diverse and successful events
calendar is a partnership between event organisers from business,
sporting and non-profit realms; the Council; the Nelson Regional
Development Agency; and the wider community.



**Council**


Nelson City Council supports events
through a mixture of direct delivery,
funding, provision of venues, and
a range of associated services e.g.
resource and noise consents, publicity
and traffic management plans.


**Nelson Regional**
**Development Agency**


The Nelson Regional Development
Agency is the first point of contact for
event organisers and the administrative
body for the Nelson Events Fund.
It coordinates and manages

communication around the Nelson

events calendar (including Its On).


The agency also provides events
marketing tools and assistance on a



cost recovery basis to events. Where
appropriate it will integrate events
support with its consumer marketing
programmes and seek opportunities
for events to leverage Nelson Regional
Development Agency’s industry
partnerships.


**Local Event Industry**


Nelson has a well-established

community of events organisers

and technicians who work in both

professional and voluntary capacities

to deliver events for Nelson. A clear

strategy for events and the ability to
collaborate closely with Council and
the Nelson Regional Development
Agency will support their essential

contribution to the Nelson events

calendar.



**Page 6** Nelson City Council Events Strategy




##### **EVENTS** **FRAMEWORK**

An Events Development Committee, comprising two officers from Nelson City
Council and two from the Nelson Regional Development Agency will oversee the
implementation of this Strategy and manage the Nelson Events Fund. Delegated
authority for allocating events funding by the Committee will be set by Council.
Guidelines for the assessment of applications to the Nelson Events Fund will also
be set by Council.



A Community Events Advisory Group will meet
as necessary to provide input to the Events
Development Committee, ensure the wider
Council work programme and knowledge
about community views are understood and
taken into account in funding decisions on
community events. The Community Events
Advisory Group will comprise the Chairs of the
Community Services and Sports and Recreation
Committees (with their Deputies as alternates).
The Chairs of the Community Services and
Sports and Recreation Committees are
mandated to approve the co-opting of
additional members to the Community Events
Advisory Group as deemed necessary.


The Events Development Committee
will report to Council once a year on
implementation of the Strategy including
event funding and event evaluation, as well as



opportunities to improve the clarity and value

of Council services to events.


The Nelson Regional Development Agency
will establish a customer facing regional event
coordination and development role which will
provide a single contact point responsible for
all economic and community event enquiries,
applications, event coordination, development
and marketing.


The Nelson Regional Development Agency will
work closely with event organisers to leverage
public sector assets, relationships and tools to
improve regional events marketing. The Events
Development Committee may direct that
portions of Council funding for a particular
event be allocated to or guided by the Nelson
Regional Development Agency to achieve a
more integrated marketing outcome.

##### **NELSON** **EVENTS FUND**

Council will resource a Nelson Events Fund with

two components, one to support events that foster
community wellbeing and social outcomes, the other to
support events that grow Nelson’s economy.


While there are separate funding streams for each it is recognised
that most events bring benefits in both these areas and many of
our most valuable economic events began and continue to be
successful because they connect with our local residents through
building community pride, learning and relationships.


The Nelson Events Fund aims to support and develop events
that contribute economic and community wellbeing benefits to
Nelson, build social capital and cohesion, increase visitors during
shoulder and off peak seasons and enhance the city and regional
profile nationally and internationally. The Fund aims to support
the Nelson Events Strategy by optimising the use of public sector
resources to stimulate a rich and coordinated Nelson City events

programme.


The Nelson Events Fund recognises that events have a lifecycle and
that the support required during the early stages of development
may be different to that required for a mature event. It also
recognises that even highly successful events may reach a point
where interest and relevance diminish and ratepayer funding
needs to transfer to other emerging events.

**GUIDING PRINCIPLES**

The following are the principles against which events will
be assessed for funding from the Nelson Events Fund.



**1**


**2**


**3**



**STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT**

Events should align with the regional identity framework
and, where aiming to deliver economic value, should have
relevance for our identified target markets (see Appendix 1).


Events should also align with relevant Council policy.


**DELIVERY AGAINST STRATEGY** **OBJECTIVES**


Delivery of the strategy’s objectives needs to be clearly
demonstrated in economic and/or community wellbeing

terms. For economic benefit a desirable return on

investment will be assessed on a case by case basis.


Note: _Council has a return on investment target for the_
_Economic Events component of the Fund in line with a_
_national approach and which also recognises the scale of the_
_Nelson district. This is set at 20:1._


**SEASONALITY**


Events primarily delivering economic benefit should increase
the number of visitors attracted to Nelson during the ‘off
season’ period from 1 March to 30 November. Community
events can receive support during any period but preference
will be given to those that add vitality and interest to the city
during the ‘off season’. It is expected that community events
timed during Nelson’s high season will have larger audiences
available and more opportunities to be self-sufficient, thus
ratepayer support is less necessary.

**5**



**CAPACITY** **TO** **DELIVER** **OUTCOMES**


The strength of the event organiser’s application
will be assessed, including evidence of relevant skills,
capability to deliver and other sources of public funding.
The application should include a multi-year strategy
which shows an understanding of the stages of event
development and set these against relevant Key
Performance Indicators for each stage. The application
should show a pathway to sustainability and an exit point
at which Nelson Events Fund support will no longer be
required.


**CONTEXT FOR SUPPORT**


There is a limited pool of public funding to support events
and the Events Development Committee must be mindful
of the impact of funding decisions on other potentially
significant event applications and the need to retain
sufficient flexibility to respond to emerging events. Thus it
may not always be possible to support event applications,
even if they are a good fit with these principles.


Applications for the Nelson Events Fund should be
submitted to the Nelson Regional Development Agency
[using the template available at www.nrda.co.nz.](http://www.nrda.co.nz/)

**BUSINESS**
**EVENTS SALES**
**AND MARKETING**
**PROGRAMME**


Business events are a highly valued and high yielding
contributor to the Nelson events calendar which provide an
important range of shoulder season activity. The Business
Events sales and marketing programme exists to support
and grow the value of the region’s business events and
assist in securing events for the region.


The programme is focused on raising awareness, targeted lead
generation and facilitating lead conversion with our partners and on
generating outcomes in the following key activity areas:


- Business to business events including conventions and conferences
from the domestic association and corporate sector with a secondary
focus on Australian associations and corporates.


- Events that fit within the regional identity platforms and Nelson’s
sectoral areas of regional business events competitive advantage.


- Event size, timing and fit with Nelson’s venues including availability;

utilisation of council venues.


- Work with local partners to build their capability and capacity to
compete for business event markets.
