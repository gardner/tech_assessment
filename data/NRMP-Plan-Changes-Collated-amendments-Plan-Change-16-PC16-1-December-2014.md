**policy**


**IC4.2** **adverse effects**


_**Activities should not give rise to levels of noise, smell, dust, and smoke, or traffic,**_
_**landscape, aesthetic or other adverse effects which will detract from the character**_
_**being sought for the City Centre and City Fringe areas.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**IC4.2.i** The City Centre is primarily a people place. Because of this, the Plan aims
to exclude activities from the City Centre which are excessively noisy or smelly, or which
generate other effects which are inappropriate in a City Centre environment. If such
adverse effects can be controlled to a level suitable to the people oriented nature of the
City Centre, then the activity should be allowed to occur.


**IC4.2.ii** A lower level of amenity is expected in the City Fringe than in the City
Centre. For example, vehicle movements and sizes will be greater. It is however
acknowledged that fringe areas are often adjacent to more sensitive residential areas
and will still primarily serve people, in terms of them coming to the area for services or
goods. The City Fringe is not an industrial area where there is little interaction with the
general public, and where higher levels of effects might be permissible.


**Methods**
**IC4.2.iii** Rules setting performance standards for emissions such as noise, smoke,
dust, and odour.
**IC4.2.iv** Use of management practices for emissions such as noise, smoke, dust and
odour.
**IC4.2.v** Rules which require newly established producers of noise to take action to
minimise noise emission.
**IC4.2.vi** Use of sections 16, 326 and 327 of the Resource Management Act 1991, for
enforcement of unreasonable and excessive noise (see AP13).
**IC4.2.vii** Rules with a limited listing of unacceptable activities.


**policy**


**IC4.3** **residential amenity**


_**The Inner City, and sites used for residential activity, should provide a reasonable**_
_**standard of residential amenity, but recognising that the fundamental character of**_
_**the area is non-residential.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**
**IC4.3.i** The Inner City is not the suburbs and a similar level of residential amenity
cannot be expected. Higher levels of noise and glare, for example, must be expected in
the Inner City, particularly given the presence of places of assembly, licensed bars and
restaurants and other noise generating activities. Also the expectation of outdoor space
must be lower than in suburban areas. Similarly, given the height of some buildings in
the City Centre, expectation regarding privacy and sunlight must be lower. At the same
time, the policy recognises a broad bottom line to provide a reasonable level of
residential amenity in the Inner City. This recognises residential activity is a valid
activity, deserving of a degree of protection from more traditional Inner City activities.


**Methods**
**IC4.3.ii** Provision of information on opportunities for inner city living and the
relevant Resource Management Plan provisions.
**IC4.3.iii** Rules setting performance standards for residential activity.
**IC4.3.vi** Rules requiring acoustic insulation in new Bedrooms in the Inner City Zone.
**IC4.3.v** Rules setting performance standards, for emissions such as noise, smoke,
dust and odour.
**IC4.3.vi** Use of management practices for emissions such as noise, smoke, dust and
odour.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (1/12/14)** **8-13**


#### **objective** **IC5 effects on neighbouring zones**

_**Development on the edge of the Zone which does not detract from neighbouring or**_
_**nearby zones but seeks to complement in function and design the values of the**_
_**adjacent zones.**_


**Reasons**
**IC5.i** The Inner City involves a concentration of activities, and a scale of buildings,
which by their nature can have impacts on areas adjacent to, or even remote from the
Inner City. These cross boundary effects need to be addressed in order to minimise any
reduction in environmental quality in other areas.


**policy**


**IC5.1** **amenity of neighbouring areas**


_**Activities within the Inner City should not have adverse effects which significantly**_
_**diminish the amenity of neighbouring areas, having regard to the character of these**_
_**areas and the cumulative effects of such activities.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**
**IC5.1.i** Any impacts that activities in the Inner City have on neighbouring areas need
to take account of the nature of that area. Residential areas and activities will be more
sensitive to certain effects such as noise and glare, than commercial areas. Also a single
activity may have effects that are acceptable to residential activities, but the addition
of further similar activities may eventually lead to an unacceptable level of effect. The
policy aims to address such cumulative effects.


**Method**
**IC5.1.ii** Rules setting performance standards, and the use of management practices,
for emissions such as noise, smoke, dust, and odour.


**policy**


**IC5.2** **residential zones**


_**Special regard shall be had to preventing any deterioration of the amenity of the**_
_**Residential Zone as a result of expansion of activities from the Inner City Zone, or**_
_**as a result of adverse effects across the zone boundary**_


**Explanation and Reasons**
**IC5.2.i** A reasonably liberal approach is being taken to the type of activity that can
establish within the Inner City Zone. A tough line will be taken, however, to limit the
intrusion of the Zone into the Residential Zone. This could be either directly in terms of
physical expansion, or in terms of effects which impact on residential areas.


**Methods**
**IC5.2.ii** Rules with performance standards for effects such as noise and odour.
**IC5.2.iii** Rules requiring landscaping buffers, application of the residential noise
standards and daylight angles along any residentially zoned site.


**policy**


**IC5.3** **traffic**


_**The adverse effects on other areas of traffic generated by activities within the**_
_**Inner City, including any cumulative effects, should be avoided, remedied, or**_
_**mitigated.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**
**IC5.3.i** The success of the City Centre can generate traffic impacts particularly
around the periphery, but potentially in more remote locations too. These impacts need
to be avoided, remedied or mitigated, taking account of the nature of the area affected.

|ICr.55A.4<br>In considering applications for landfills, Council will restrict its discretion<br>to the matters identified in ICr.55A.3 provided that the application does<br>not contravene a restricted discretionary condition.|ICr.55A.5<br>Landfill development and operation are restricted discretionary<br>activities, provided conditions in ICr.55A.3 are met.  While landfills<br>generally involve earthworks and modify the shape of the land, their<br>primary purpose is the disposal of solid waste.  The concentration of<br>solid waste, often containing contaminants, within landfill sites,<br>increases the potential for adverse effects on the environment beyond<br>that associated with normal earthworks.  Additional adverse effects<br>may include generation of leachate, discharge of gas, geotechnical<br>issues such as poor bearing strength and settlement, and<br>contamination of the land itself making it unsuitable for other uses.<br>Some landfills operate as cleanfill sites, accepting only material that<br>does not undergo any physical, chemical, or biological transformations<br>likely to cause adverse environmental effects, or health effects, once it<br>is placed in the ground.  Cleanfill operations are clearly preferable to<br>activities accepting hazardous or potentially hazardous materials, and<br>are more likely to be granted resource consent.<br>Discharges to water and air from material within landfill sites<br>also require separate regional resource consents.|

These views are important for visitors and<br>residents alike, and provide an important link between the City Centre<br>and the sea beyond.  Any proposed building or structure that would<br>impinge on the defined view shaft, will need to be assessed as a<br>discretionary activity in terms of its potential impact on the view shaft.<br>The view up Trafalgar Street is an important part of the view shaft.<br>Rule ICr.21 (Buildings over road reserve) controls the intrusion of<br>structures that might block this view eg. walkways connecting<br>buildings, enclosed verandahs.|

|ICr.64.4<br>The Assessment Criteria in Rules ICr.60 and ICr.62 (Heritage Buildings, Places<br>and Objects) will apply.<br>In addition, particular regard will be had to:<br>a)<br>for the City Centre precincts, the degree of compliance with the Nelson<br>City Centre Design Guide.<br>b)<br>the degree of compliance with the South Street Design Guide.<br>c)<br>any effects (positive and negative) on the heritage values of the entire<br>heritage precinct.<br>d)<br>any cumulative or precedent effects on the heritage values of the precinct.|ICr.64.5<br>The Heritage Precincts recognise the whole is often greater than the<br>sum of the parts.  That is, that a collection of heritage buildings in<br>context, has a greater impact to the observer and the resident, and<br>has greater heritage value, than the same number of buildings<br>scattered throughout the City.  The loss or the unsympathetic<br>alteration to even a single building can have major impacts on the<br>entire precinct - rather like a missing tooth from a smile. The controls<br>therefore focus on retaining Group A and B listed heritage buildings,<br>and ensuring that any significant alterations are in keeping with the<br>heritage values of the precinct.<br>NOTE: THE CITY CENTRE DESIGN GUIDE, AND THE SOUTH ST<br>DESIGN GUIDE APPLY – Copies are available from the City Council.<br>See also Ap20r.4 (signs on heritage items or listed trees) in relation to<br>signs on heritage buildings and trees.|

This does not mean that<br>new buildings have to be replicas of heritage buildings, but rather that<br>they have design features which fit with the character of the precinct.<br>Similarly, there are design controls on significant alterations to existing<br>non-listed buildings within the heritage precinct.  The purpose of this is<br>to promote a gradual improvement in the compatibility of these<br>buildings with the heritage buildings, where this is practicable.  As with<br>rule ICr.28 (external design and appearance), work below verandah<br>level is permitted on buildings in the City Centre heritage precincts (i.e.<br>the main commercial streets).  This enables businesses to adapt<br>building frontages to their changing needs without having to get a<br>resource consent.  Such changes have little effect on the overall<br>streetscape.  The City Centre Design Guide seeks to control the<br>height, scale, and modulation of buildings overall, and the<br>appearance at and above verandah level.<br>See also Rule ICr.63 (Heritage Buildings, Places and Objects<br>demolition or removal of Group C items).<br>NOTE: THE CITY CENTRE DESIGN GUIDE, AND THE SOUTH ST<br>DESIGN GUIDE APPLY – Copies are available from the City Council|

# **appendix 13** **Inner City Zone:** **Noise** **Management** **Plans and** **assessment of** **unreasonable** **and excessive** **noise**

**Nelson Resource Management Plan (1/12/14)** **A13-1**


#### **AP13 Overview**

Relating to rule ICr.42A this appendix prescribes the matters that shall be included in
the Noise Management Plans for new and extended Noise Generating Activities. The
overall intent of a Noise Management Plan is that the best practicable option is
undertaken to ensure that the emission of noise from a site does not exceed a

reasonable level.


This appendix also sets out aspects which may help form an opinion for assessment of
unreasonable and excessive noise in terms of the Resource Management Act 1991. This
can be applicable to all zones but in particular this will be the approach undertaken
within the Inner City Zone (City Centre and City Fringe, including the Intense
Development Area).

#### **AP13.1 Noise Generating Activities**


**AP13.1.1** **Minimum Noise Management Plan Provisions**


**AP13.1.1.i** The Noise Management Plan required under Rule ICr.42A shall be prepared
by a professional acoustic engineer and shall, at a minimum, contain the following:


a) The intended outcomes of the Noise Management Plan, including the design sound
level to be received outside of the building and site.
b) A description of the premises including details of walls, roof, cladding, door
openings and windows, ventilation, site layout, outdoor areas and any acoustic
insulation or noise barriers that have been, or will be, installed, and a description of
how these assist to reduce noise and meet the design sound level specified above.
c) A description of the surrounding land uses and in particular residential or short term
living accommodation units, including a description of the existing sound
environment in the area.
d) A description of all noise generating activities carried out in the premises or on the
site.
e) A floor plan of the premises, including outdoor areas, with the noise sources marked
on it.
f) The hours of operation of the noise generating activities.
g) The specifications of the sound systems and any mechanisms to govern the
maximum noise output.
h) Details of any noise data that has been recorded, and any noise modelling; noise
monitoring; auditing and reporting procedures, including methods used.
i) Any methods proposed to manage noise produced by patrons, including either
leaving the venue or queuing for entry.
j) The name and contact details of the manager responsible for noise generating
activities in the premises.
k) Complaint handling and recording procedures, and
l) Procedures for achieving noise reduction through operational procedures and staff
training.


**AP13.1.2** **Minimum Monitoring and Reporting Requirements**


**AP13.2.i** The minimum monitoring and reporting requirements on any approved
consent and associated Noise Management Plan are as follows:


a) A inventory shall be kept of all noise sources at the premises, and
b) Copies of the Noise Management Plan and the inventory required above are to be
held at the premises and made available to Council staff as, and when, requested.


**A13-2** **(1/12/14) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


**AP13.1.3** **Measurement and Assessment of Noise**


**AP13.1.3.i** The measurement of noise is to be in accordance with NZS 6801:2008 and
assessed in accordance with NZS6802:2008

#### **AP13.2 Assessment of unreasonable and excessive noise**


**AP13.2.1** **Noise assessment criteria**


**AP13.2.1.i** Nelson City Council's Enforcement Officers, for the purposes of assessing
compliance with permitted activity conditions, relevant resource consent conditions,
and sections 16(1) (which requires consideration whether the best practicable option is
being undertaken to ensure noise does not exceed a reasonable level), or in forming an
opinion under section 327(1) of the Resource Management Act, Excessive Noise
Direction, will generally take into account the following matters when determining
whether or not noise is unreasonable or excessive:


i.) the **frequency** (number of events) of noise emission, and
ii.) the **intensity** of the noise, as indicated by volume, tone, and audio frequency
and the degree of disturbance, and
iii.) the **duration** of each noise event, and
iv.) the **nature** of the noise, and
v.) the **location and timing** of the noise, having regard to the time of day or night
and the sensitivity (including reverse sensitivity) of the receiving environment.


**AP13.2.1.ii** Assessment may also consider the following matters.


a) Other noise complaints or events relating to emissions from the same location
which have been found to be unreasonable or excessive, including what remedial
action has previously been undertaken.
b) Where possible and relevant, sound level measurements from a calibrated sound
level meter.
c) Information regarding the effectiveness of any noise management plan, or on site
noise management.


**AP13.2.2** **Construction Noise**


**AP13.2.2.i** Construction activity by necessity can produce higher levels of noise than
would be expected, or be deemed reasonable, from other activities. In recognition of
this Standards New Zealand have produced NZS 6803:1999 Acoustics - Construction
Noise. In assessing construction noise produced in the Inner City Zone, Nelson City
Council will use this standard, in addition to the points outlined in AP13.2.1.i and
AP13.2.1.ii, as a guide to the reasonableness of the construction noise produced.


**AP13.2.2.ii** Separately to this appendix, rule ICr.43 provides that the provisions of NZS
6803:1999 Acoustics - Construction Noise apply to construction noise received in the
Residential Zone.

**Nelson Resource Management Plan (14/07/07)** **A19-3**


#### **AP19.2 Port Effects Control Overla** **y**

**AP19.2.i** Acoustic insulation requirements for the Port Effects Control Overlay area
included in the rules for the respective zones. However, no minimum construction
requirements for habitable spaces are specified for the Port Effects Control Overlay.
Instead, the rules require certification from an acoustic engineer that the building
design will achieve the required design sound level for that zone and certification on
completion of the works.

**AP19.2.ii** In addition, where the indoor design level cannot be achieved with
ventilating windows open, the minimum ventilation requirements for habitable spaces
require either:

a) A mechanical system or mechanical ventilation system capable of:


            - providing at least 15 air changes of outdoor air per hour in the principal living
room of each building and give 5 air changes of outdoor air per hour in the
other habitable spaces of each building, in each case with all external doors
and windows of the building closed with the exception of such windows in nonhabitable spaces that need to be ajar to provide air relief paths;

            - enabling the rate of airflow to be controlled across the range, from the
maximum airflow capacity down to 0.5 air changes (plus or minus 0.1) of
outdoor air per hour in all habitable spaces;

            - limiting internal air pressure to not more than 30 Pascals above ambient air

pressure;

            - being individually switched on and off by the building occupants, in the case of
each system; and

            - creating no more than 40 dB LAeq(15 min) in the principal living room, no more
than 30 dB LAeq(15 min) in the other habitable spaces, and no more than 50 dB
LAeq(15 min) any hallway, in each building. Sound levels from the mechanical
system(s) shall be measured at least one meter away from any diffuser.

Note: This is the ventilation option provided for by the Port Noise Mitigation
Plan. In the event that qualifying residents opt for the following (more
expensive) air conditioning option (option b), those residents shall be required
to pay the difference.


or:


b) Air conditioning plus mechanical outdoor air ventilation capable of:


            - providing internal temperatures in habitable spaces not greater than 25 degrees
Celsius at 5% ambient design conditions as published by the National Institute of
Water & Atmosphere Research (NIWA) (NIWA,Design Temperatures for Air
Conditioning (degrees Celsius), Data Period 1991-2000), with all external doors
and windows of the habitable spaces closed;

            - providing 0.5 air changes (plus or minus 0.1) of outdoor air per hour in all
habitable spaces;

            - each of the air conditioning and mechanical ventilation systems shall be
capable of being individually switched on and off by the building occupants;
and

            - creating no more than 40 dB LAeq(15 min) in the principal living room, no more
than 30 dB LAeq(15 min) in the other habitable spaces, and no more than 40 dB
LAeq(15 min) in any hallway, in each building. Sound levels from the mechanical
sytems(s) shall be measured at least one metre away from any diffuser.


and:


c) a mechanical kitchen extractor fan ducted directly to the outside to serve any
cooking hob, if such an extractor fan is not already installed and in sound working
order.


**A19-4** **(1/12/14)** **Nelson Resource Management Plan**


**AP19.2.iii** A single Residential Unit may contain a combination of the ventilation
options a) and b) set out above to achieve the most practicable and cost effective
approach. As an example it may be best for the principal living room to comply with
option b) whilst the other habitable spaces may comply with option a).

#### **AP19.3 Inner Cit Zone** **y**


**AP19.3.i** Acoustic insulation requirements for the Inner City Zone are included in
the rule ICr.43A 'Acoustic Insulation of Buildings'. Under this rule a choice can be made
between minimum construction requirements or having the acoustic insulation
specifically designed for the proposed development. When designing acoustic insulation
the rule requires certification from an acoustic engineer that the building design will
achieve the required design sound level.

**AP19.3.ii** This appendix sets out the minimum ventilation requirements for new
Bedrooms in the Inner City Zone where the indoor design level cannot be achieved with
ventilating windows open. These require either:

a) A mechanical system or mechanical ventilation system capable of:


           - 5 air changes of outdoor air per hour in new bedrooms. In each case with all
external doors and windows of the building closed with the exception of such
windows in non-habitable spaces that need to be ajar to provide air relief
paths;

           - enabling the rate of airflow to be controlled across the range, from the
maximum airflow capacity down to 0.5 air changes (plus or minus 0.1) of
outdoor air per hour in all new bedrooms;

           - limiting internal air pressure to not more than 30 Pascals above ambient air

pressure;

           - being individually switched on and off by the building occupants, in the case of
each system; and

           - creating no more than 30 dB LAeq(15 min) in new bedrooms. Sound levels from the
mechanical system(s) shall be measured at least one metre away from any
diffuser.

or:

a) Air conditioning plus mechanical outdoor air ventilation capable of:


           - providing internal temperatures in new bedrooms not greater than 25 degrees
Celsius at 5% ambient design conditions as published by the National Institute of
Water & Atmosphere Research (NIWA) (NIWA, Design Temperatures for Air
Conditioning (degrees Celsius), Data Period 1991-2000), with all external doors
and windows of the new bedrooms closed;

           - providing 0.5 air changes (plus or minus 0.1) of outdoor air per hour in all new
bedrooms;

           - each of the air conditioning and mechanical ventilation systems shall be
capable of being individually switched on and off by the building occupants;
and

           - creating no more than 30 dB LAeq(15 min) in new bedrooms. Sound levels from the
mechanical system(s) shall be measured at least one metre away from any
diffuser.

**AP19.3.iii** Individual rooms in a single Residential Unit may contain a combination of
the ventilation options a) and b) set out above to achieve the most practicable and cost
effective approach.
