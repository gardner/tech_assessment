**TASMAN BAYS HERITAGE TRUST - STATEMENT OF EXPECTATIONS**


This Letter of Expectation is intended to inform the Tasman Bays Heritage Trust Board
of the councils' high-level strategic direction and performance expectations in
advance of your preparation of the Statement of Intent (SOI) 2023/24. In clarifying
our expectations early, we expect that the passage through to acceptance by both

councils will be more efficient and effective.


The councils are expecting active and regular reporting to the Joint Committee on
the development of the final business case for their proposed investment in the new
Archive Research and Collections facility. The trust should note that each council will
follow its own funding approval process. The final business case should include
confirmation of other sources of funding (including funding for cost escalations and
overruns).


**Statement of Intent 2023/24**


The Tasman District and Nelson City Councils expect that all their Council Controlled
Organisations (CCOs) will treat the SOI as more than a strict compliance document
and will aim for best practice. This will entail an SOI covering more than the statutory
minimum requirements. To be effective, your SOI should tell the performance story
of the organisation, providing a clear and succinct understanding of the organisation's
purpose, the goods and services it delivers and what success looks like. In line with
the Local Government Act 2002, the councils are particularly interested in efficiency

and effectiveness.


The SOis must meet the requirements set out in the Local Government Act. The Local
Government Act 2002 set out requirements for SOis differentiating between matters
to be covered in all SOis and those that are specific to trading and non-trading CCOs.


Internal Document ID: NDOCS-1511110536-531


Both councils wish to support the Trust in delivering a good SOI. We have assigned
a senior manager to each CCO to assist. In your case, the people assigned are Andrew
White and John Ridd. They are available to your team to assist throughout the

process.


The general expectations for all CCOs are as follows:


1.1 SOis must include a complete set of summary prospective financial
statements for at least three years (preferably five years) i.e.,
Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Financial
Position and Cash Flow statement.


1.2 SOis should disclose measures like Earnings before Interest and
Tax (EBIT) and Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and
Amortisation (EBITDA) and balance sheet ratios where applicable
i.e., CCTOs.


1.3 SOis must fully comply with Schedule 8 of the LGA 2002.


1.4 In the Public Records Act 2005, a local authority includes a
(Council Controlled) (Council-Controlled Trading) Organisation. As
such, the requirements of this Act and its related mandatory
Information and Records Management Standard - July 2016
applies for the management, retention, and disposal of records.


1.5 Compliance with legislation and reporting on Health and Safety
matters must be given due emphasis.


1.6 Proposed dividends are to be disclosed along with the dividend
pay-out policies, where applicable.


1. 7 Where the councils make a financial contribution to the operational
costs of the organisation, the CCO should show how it intends to
increase non-council revenue streams.


1.8 Capital expenditure and asset management intentions should be
included.


1.9 CCOs should use the same information for both managing the
business and reporting through to the councils/shareholders, i.e.,
the information used for setting targets and reporting against them
for the SOI should overlap and be a subset of the information used
for internal reporting.


1.10 SOis and other CCO reports should be in a plain style, concise,
relevant, accessible and focused on meeting the needs of the
shareholding councils and the public they represent. The use of
graphs, tables and charts is expected to convey both financial and
non-financial information along with trends (past, current and
future numbers).


1.11 To be effective the SOI must disclose the performance story for
the CCO, providing a clear and succinct understanding of the CCO
purpose, the goods and services it delivers and what success looks
like. Providing a clear message to the boards on these
requirements and other expectations will assist in ongoing
improvements in the SOI and reporting.


Internal Document ID: NDOCS-1511110536-531


1.12 The main aspects of the SOI performance story are:


      - Strategic context


      - Specifying and presentation of the outcome's framework


      - Main measures and targets, outcomes and objectives


      Linking the strategy outputs performance together.


1.13 **Risk management** - Shareholders/the councils would like to see
documented in the SOI how the boards are managing risks,
including natural hazards and climate change.


1.14 **Sustainability** - Shareholders would like to understand what
measures and targets are in place to address environmental and
climate change concerns, including measures to:


      Support the transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050;


      Prepare for the impacts of climate change, including assessing
key organisational climate change risks;


      - Minimise waste and support the shift to a circular economy,
and


      - Work towards Climate Related Disclosure reporting by 2024.


1.15 **Health and safety** - Given the requirements of the Health and
Safety at Work Act 2015 (the Act), it is appropriate for the councils
to set out their expectations in relation to Health and Safety in the
CCOs/CCTOs.


1.15.1 Under Section 44 (3) of the Act elected members do not
have a duty to exercise due diligence to ensure that any
Council Controlled Organisation complies with its duties
or obligations under the Act unless that member is also
an officer of that Council Controlled Organisation.


1.15.2 However, as shareholders being a key funder, it is still
appropriate to set out expectations of Health and Safety
management in CCOs/CCTOs.


1.15.3 The councils/shareholders expect the boards of the
jointly held CCOs/CCTOs to set appropriate Health and
Safety strategies and policy, understand the nature of
risks/hazards within the business, monitor performance
and activities to ensure risk is being managed and review
Health and Safety systems and performance.


1.16 **Relationships** - Specify how the organisation intends to conduct
its relationships with;


1.16.1 its shareholding local authorities; and


1.16.2 its subsidiary companies (if applicable); and


Internal Document ID: NDOCS-1511110536-531


1.16.3 the Tasman and Nelson communities, including parties
considered as stakeholders within those communities;
and


1.16.4 Iwi, hapO, and other Maori organisations.


1.17 Shareholders/the councils require that CCOs/CCTOs, before
making a decision that may significantly affect land or a body of
water, must consider the relationship of Maori and their culture
and traditions with their ancestral land, water, sites, wahi tapu,
valued flora and fauna, and other taonga.


1.18 **Governance performance**     - in order to aid the councils when
making decisions on director/trustee remuneration and
appointments, the boards should undertake a regular evaluation of
their performance.


1.18.1 The councils expect these reviews to be carried out at
least once every eighteen months.


1.18.2 The chairs of the boards should reference this evaluation
when making recommendations on the re-appointment
or recruitment of board members.


1.19 The Boards/Trust should ensure that there is 'no surprises'
communication with the shareholder councils on matters which are
in the public interest and are not highly commercially sensitive.


General expectations related to the effects or mitigation of COVID-19 have been
removed as the pandemic effects are expected to lessen over the coming year,
most government mandates have been removed, and COVID-19 management will
become business as usual. Any ongoing impacts on dividend streams should be
addressed in the relevant sections of the SOI.


There are no specific expectations to be included in the Trust's SOI.


**Important Dates 2023**


Andrew White will notify you of the committee meeting dates for 2023 to assist you
with your planning.


If you have any queries, please contact Andrew on (03) 545 8729 /
andrew.white@ncc.govt.nz in the first instance.
