**INFRASTRUCTURE HOLDINGS LIMITED - STATEMENT OF EXPECTATION**


This Letter of Expectation is intended to inform the Infrastructure Holdings Limited
Board of the councils’ high-level strategic direction and performance expectations in
advance of your preparation of the Group Statement of Intent (SOI) 2023/24. In
clarifying our expectations early, we expect that the passage through to acceptance by
both councils will be more efficient and effective. The shareholders are closely following
the transition and implementation of the Infrastructure Holdings Limited (IHL) structure.


**Statement of Intent 2023/24**


The Tasman District and Nelson City Councils expect that all their Council Controlled
Organisations (CCOs) will treat the SOI as more than a strict compliance document and
will aim for best practice. This will entail an SOI covering more than the statutory
minimum requirements. To be effective, your SOI should tell the performance story of
the group, providing a clear and succinct understanding of the group’s purpose, the
goods and services it delivers and what success looks like. In line with the Local
Government Act 2002, the councils are particularly interested in efficiency and
effectiveness.


The SOIs must meet the requirements set out in the Local Government Act. The Local
Government Act 2002 set out requirements for SOIs differentiating between matters to
be covered in all SOIs and those that are specific to trading and non-trading CCOs.


Both councils wish to support IHL in delivering a good SOI. We have assigned a senior
manager to each CCO to assist. In your case, the person assigned is Nikki Harrison.
Nikki is available to your team to assist throughout the process.


The general expectations for all CCOs are as follows:


1.1 SOIs must include a complete set of summary prospective financial
statements for at least three years (preferably five years) i.e.,
Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Financial Position
and Cash Flow statement.


1.2 SOIs should disclose measures like Earnings before Interest and Tax
(EBIT) and Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and
Amortisation (EBITDA) and balance sheet ratios where applicable i.e.,
CCTOs.


Internal Document ID: NDOCS-1511110536-530


1.3 SOIs must fully comply with Schedule 8 of the LGA 2002.


1.4 In the Public Records Act 2005, a local authority includes a (Council
Controlled) (Council-Controlled Trading) Organisation. As such, the
requirements of this Act and its related mandatory Information and
Records Management Standard - July 2016 applies for the
management, retention, and disposal of records.


1.5 Compliance with legislation and reporting on Health and Safety
matters must be given due emphasis.


1.6 Proposed dividends are to be disclosed along with the dividend payout policies, where applicable.


1.7 Where the councils make a financial contribution to the operational
costs of the organisation, the CCO should show how it intends to
increase non-council revenue streams.


1.8 Capital expenditure and asset management intentions should be
included.


1.9 CCOs should use the same information for both managing the
business and reporting through to the councils/shareholders, i.e., the
information used for setting targets and reporting against them for
the SOI should overlap and be a subset of the information used for
internal reporting.


1.10 SOIs and other CCO reports should be in a plain style, concise,
relevant, accessible and focused on meeting the needs of the
shareholding councils and the public they represent. The use of
graphs, tables and charts is expected to convey both financial and
non-financial information along with trends (past, current and future
numbers).


1.11 To be effective the SOI must disclose the performance story for the
CCO, providing a clear and succinct understanding of the CCO
purpose, the goods and services it delivers and what success looks
like. Providing a clear message to the boards on these requirements
and other expectations will assist in ongoing improvements in the SOI
and reporting.


1.12 The main aspects of the SOI performance story are:


     - Strategic context


     Specifying and presentation of the outcome’s framework


     - Main measures and targets, outcomes and objectives


     Linking the strategy outputs performance together.


1.13 **Risk management** – Shareholders/the councils would like to see
documented in the SOI how the boards are managing risks, including
natural hazards and climate change.


1.14 **Sustainability** - Shareholders would like to understand what
measures and targets are in place to address environmental and
climate change concerns, including measures to:


     - Support the transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050;


     Prepare for the impacts of climate change, including assessing key
organisational climate change risks;


Internal Document ID: NDOCS-1511110536-530


     Minimise waste and support the shift to a circular economy, and


     - Work towards Climate Related Disclosure reporting, by 2024.


1.15 **Health and safety** - Given the requirements of the Health and
Safety at Work Act 2015 (the Act), it is appropriate for the councils to
set out their expectations in relation to Health and Safety in the
CCOs/CCTOs.


1.15.1 Under Section 44 (3) of the Act elected members do not
have a duty to exercise due diligence to ensure that any
Council Controlled Organisation complies with its duties or
obligations under the Act unless that member is also an
officer of that Council Controlled Organisation.


1.15.2 However, as shareholders being a key funder, it is still
appropriate to set out expectations of Health and Safety
management in CCOs/CCTOs.


1.15.3 The councils/shareholders expect the boards of the jointly
held CCOs/CCTOs to set appropriate Health and Safety
strategies and policy, understand the nature of
risks/hazards within the business, monitor performance and
activities to ensure risk is being managed and review Health
and Safety systems and performance.


1.16 **Relationships** - Specify how the organisation intends to conduct its
relationships with;


1.16.1 its shareholding local authorities; and


1.16.2 its subsidiary companies (if applicable); and


1.16.3 the Tasman and Nelson communities, including parties
considered as stakeholders within those communities; and


1.16.4 Iwi, hapū, and other Māori organisations.


1.17 Shareholders/the councils require that CCOs/CCTOs, before making a
decision that may significantly affect land or a body of water, must
consider the relationship of Māori and their culture and traditions with
their ancestral land, water, sites, wāhi tapu, valued flora and fauna,
and other taonga.


1.18 **Governance performance** - in order to aid the councils when
making decisions on director/trustee remuneration and appointments,
the boards should undertake a regular evaluation of their
performance.


1.18.1 The councils expect these reviews to be carried out at least
once every eighteen months.


1.18.2 The chairs of the boards should reference this evaluation
when making recommendations on the re-appointment or
recruitment of board members.


1.19 **No surprises** -The Boards should ensure that there is ‘no surprises’
communication with the shareholder councils on matters which are in
the public interest and are not highly commercially sensitive.


1.20 **General expectations** related to the effects or mitigation of COVID19 have been removed as the pandemic effects are expected to
lessen over the coming year, most government mandates have been
removed, and COVID-19 management will become business as usual.


Internal Document ID: NDOCS-1511110536-530


Any ongoing impacts on dividend streams should be addressed in the
relevant sections of the SOI.


1.21 **Specific expectations** in relation to Infrastructure Holdings Limited
to be included in the SOI 2023/24:


1.21.1 Inclusion of key financial covenants, aligned with the lender’s

covenants, which allow the shareholder councils to
proactively monitor the performance of the group and
exposure of the shareholders to the uncalled capital.


1.21.2 Inclusion of projected capital programs and debt for the

Group for up to 10 years;


1.21.3 Inclusion of the Pitt and Moore table laying out

responsibilities and structuring of the three boards as part of
the Statement of Intent.


1.22 **Specific expectations** in relation to Port Nelson Limited and Nelson
Airport Limited


1.22.1 In addition to the general expectations in relation to climate
change, shareholders expect that Climate Resilience Plans
are developed and implemented for the Port and Airport.


**Important Dates 2023**


Nikki Harrison will notify you of the committee meeting dates for 2023 to assist you with
your planning.
