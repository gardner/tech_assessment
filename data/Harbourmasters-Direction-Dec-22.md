#### Foreword


Nelson City Council has adopted the New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code
(the Code) and applies the principles described within the code to marine operations on
the region's waters.
The movement of vessels within the Nelson Regional Waters and the Code application
area (wider Tasman Bay) is subject to control and direction by the respective Nelson and
Tasman Harbourmasters. This Direction sets control measures that are applicable across
the region, or a specific area or operation, to enable the adequate implementation of

the code.

The purpose of this Direction is to enhance the regulatory framework in place in Nelson
to ensure maritime safety. However, the Harbourmaster acknowledges that matters
contained in this Direction may be more appropriately regulated through Bylaws. As
such, all matters contained in this Direction will be proposed as Bylaws during the next
Navigation Bylaw review.
