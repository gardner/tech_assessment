1. The Nelson School of Music Trust Statement of Intent 2023 – 2025

1.1. Context

1.1.1. Entity

The Nelson School of Music Trust is an autonomous not–for–profit charitable
trust trading as Nelson Centre of Musical Arts (NCMA).

1.1.2. Legislation

The Trust is not owned or controlled by Council. Under the Local Government
Act 2002 NCMA is treated as a Council Organisation and is not required to
submit a Statement of Intent.

1.1.3. Existing relationship

1.1.3.1. NCMA receives an annual operational grant from Council

1.1.3.2. Council appoints two of the six Trustees on the Nelson School of Music

Trust Board.

1.1.3.3. Council has funded an interest-free loan to NCMA with a value of

$696,551 at 31 December, 2022. NCMA services this loan with
repayments of $8,250 quarterly.

1.1.3.4. In June 2022, Council resolved to develop a Memorandum of

Understanding describing the relationship between NCMA and Council.


An MOU has been drafted and submitted to Council for feedback. This
document has been prepared based on the draft MOU.

1.1.4. Intent

An independent review of NCMA’s business model in 2019 identified the
relationship between Council and NCMA to be of concern. The review
recommended the parties adopt an SOE / SOI planning and reporting model
in the place of the grant funding model in place at that time.


In the context of that review, NCMA intends the outcomes of the SOE / SOI
process will be:


        Regular alignment of NCMA’s delivery for the Community with Council’s
strategic planning for the arts (strategic alignment for 2023 is discussed
in sections 2 and 3).

        Improved mutual understanding of both parties’ operational
requirements and intentions, and

        - A stronger and more productive relationship between Council and
NCMA to the benefit of the wider community.


Draft: Friday, 10 February 2023


Page 4 of 31


1.1.5. Performance Measures

The outcomes and performance measures agreed through this SOE / SOI
process are intended to inform and substitute for the performance measures
scheduled in typical grant funding agreements.

1.1.6. Scope

NCMA has a number of stakeholder groups, including Council, other funders
and donors, and our members. In accordance with our rules as an autonomous
organisation, NCMA’s primary responsibility is to our members.


1.1.7. Reporting alignment

In alignment with other education sector providers, NCMA reports on a
calendar year basis. Accordingly, reporting and planning detailed in this
document assumes a start date of 1 January, 2023.

1.1.8. Public Records Act 2005

The Trust is not required to align with the Public Records Act 2005.
The Trust maintains policy and procedures governing the keeping of personal
data and privacy to meet its specific needs.

1.2. Executive Summary:

With 5 years of operational data demonstrating reliability and resilience, including
through events of unprecedented global significance, decisions made in 2019 can
now be considered valid.

It is now time to look forward, planning for growth in the 2023 calendar year,
setting goals through to 2025, and building resilience over the coming decade.

1.2.1. The 2023 year ahead:

1.2.1.1. Accessibility and Resilience are our priorities:

Through outreach programmes (including the NCMA/Council initiative _Music_
_Mix_ ) and free or affordable activities for all ages, NCMA intends to engage
new learners, especially those who do not normally have the opportunity, in
the joy of making music.

The formal launch of the NCMA Foundation in July will signal the beginning of
a major fundraising campaign intended to reduce NCMA’s reliance on
charitable funding sources by 2030.


                        1.2.1.2. The ongoing impact of Covid 19


Through 2022, Covid-19 is estimated to have reduced concert attendance and
education engagement by approximately 40%, although statistics improved
steadily through the year.


Draft: Friday, 10 February 2023


Page 5 of 31


Notwithstanding the possibility of a further significant setback, this document
assumes engagement at NCMA will return to 90% of pre-Covid levels by the
end of the first quarter of 2023.

Risk management strategies through the pandemic have included:


  Prudent financial constraints, increased frequency of budget review

  - Forestalling or delaying HR appointments where practical

  Regular review of expenditure

  Rostering home / work from home / working in isolated teams to
promote service continuity

  Digital / online working options

  - Reduced service delivery as appropriate to the risk.

Current Health and safety measures:


  Contactless payment options are preferred

  - Face coverings are encouraged indoors

  Medical grade filters are now installed in large capacity spaces

  Hand sanitiser stations in high-traffic areas

  - Signage promoting responsible action

  - Heightened cleaning and sanitising procedures remain in place

  - Allocated seating and patron data collection will support contact
tracing if required.


1.2.1.3. Branding and online presence


Technological advances, the new NCMA Foundation and our focus on
accessibility have required a refresh of our branding and online presence in
2023. This project is funded with the assistance of the Lion Foundation and
other community partners.


1.2.1.4. Human Resources:


Following two years of forestalled HR appointments, we have restored the
administration team to full capacity, reinstating two key staff positions.

Since reopening in 2018 with 130 students, our education programmes have
grown by a factor of 5. The 2023 appointment of an Education Programme
Manager is accordingly full-time, managing an anticipated 700 students. This
role is 50% self-funding, in part through the restructuring of smaller education
roles.

Our Development and Funding Manager (0.7 EFT) replaces a 0.7
Communications position dis-established through Covid. The role has been refocussed on long-term resilience through the establishment and growth of the
NCMA Foundation. A companion 0.3 EFT Communications role remains in
abeyance through 2023 pending a positive outcome for the coming year.

In addition, support from the Rātā Foundation has enabled the appointment
of a dedicated staff member to provide administration and business
development services to our Pathways groups, as well as the Nelson Symphony
Orchestra and Nelson Civic Choir. This Community Music Manager role will


Draft: Friday, 10 February 2023


Page 6 of 31


grow revenues for all three parties and is envisaged to become budget-neutral
by 2025.

While our staff has only expanded by 23% since 2022, three factors have
contributed to an HR cost increase of 50% in 2023: inflation, operational
growth and the delayed effect of forestalled HR movements through the
pandemic. This increased expenditure will be a significant challenge over the
coming year.


1.2.2. Priorities over the next three years:


       - Explore solar energy to contribute to our community’s environmental
sustainability

       - Utilise technology to streamline administration, and reduce overheads

       - Build sponsorship and partnerships with local business and community

       Rebuild and diversify NCMA-produced concerts

       Enhance administration support and promote business development for
our affiliated community music providers

       Through partnerships with national arts industry professional bodies,
provide meaningful career development opportunities for our Teachers
and Students.

       - Continue to grow our Music Therapy programme.

       - Informed by _Shared Communities_, continue to ensure our activities are
adequately informed by cultural perspective.


1.3. Organisational Description

NCMA is Nelson’s leading community music organisation. We are a bustling,
thriving community hub that is accessible, affordable and inclusive. We have
delivered quality music experiences and diverse educational opportunities to the

|Col1|KPI|2022|
|---|---|---|
|Concertsproduced in-house|62|54|

Page 9 of 31


3.5. Facility

Produce a range of activities, make the facility available for hire, and secure
operational funding to ensure a financially secure operation.

Revenue is from the hire of our venue for events and private music lessons.
External venue hire contributes 10% of NCMA’s total revenue but requires us to
cease all other activity necessitating a careful balance.

2023 objective: Increase facility use 9am – 3pm, eg: adult beginner classes.
(Outside these times the facility is normally at capacity).

|Col1|KPI|2022|
|---|---|---|
|Affiliated Groups*|4|4|
|Hire revenues**|$127,000|$92,285|



    - Affiliated music groups include local choirs and orchestras that use our facilities
regularly at reduced rates. In 2023 they receive a 50% discount on commercial
hire rates.


In 2023 NCMA has introduced a new full-time administration position in support
of these groups. NCMA is funding 80% of that position.

** Venue hire charges are increased by 10% in 2023.
HR is refocussed on venue hire in 2023.

5.4. Strategic development


5.4.1. Financial sustainability

The NSOM Trust Board have committed to the launch of the NCMA
Foundation: a long-term development project that aims to reduce the Trust’s
reliance on charitable funding. This project seeks to significantly grow the
existing pool of endowment funds.


Together with Nelson Building Society and Craig’s Investment Partners, we are
pleased to introduce the NCMA Foundation, an autonomous charitable trust,
intended to reduce NCMA’s reliance on contestable funding sources.

The NCMA Foundation will launch in July and will build between now and
2030. Our fundraising goal is aspirational: $10 Million, by 2030.

The Foundation is structured around a “preserved capital fund” designed to
grow rapidly, and perpetually. Distributions from that fund will be limited to
interest earned, after inflation and costs, ensuring the value of the capital
invested is maintained.


Four further “named donor funds” have already been seeded and established,
from which interest earned, together with a limited portion of the capital sum
may be distributed annually. These named donor funds are designed to
provide practical support for specific activities:


`o` The Cowie Bryant Fund for Education
`o` The Kerr Hossain Family Fund for Community and Wellbeing
`o` The Nelson Pine Industries fund for Performance and Events, and
`o` The Pastorius Waller fund for Operations and Infrastructure.


Each sum contributed to the

Foundation will be invested

half in the relevant donor fund,
and half in the preserved
capital fund, ensuring that the
Foundation always has
resources to administer itself
as well as support NCMA.

Current efforts are focussed on
the finalising of a Trust Deed,
the registration of the
Foundation as a charitable
trust, and the writing of
appropriate Statements of
Investment Policy and
Objectives.


To this end the Trust have engaged an experienced and dedicated
Development, Funding and Communications Manager who will work directly
with a dedicated Development committee.

                       5.4.3. Realising the potential of our world class facility

    Lead, as the overarching independent music education specialist for the
Nelson region, working with existing providers such as primary and
secondary schools.

    - Growing partnerships with tertiary education establishments nationally and

on venue suitability, sharing of production services including ticketing and
research for partner productions.

    Encourage regional and national bodies to hold festival events at the
Centre, researching the option of shared risk production.

    - Explore activities compatible with its goals that will contribute to local
economies.

NCMA has responded to the pandemic with prudent action through an
unprecedented period of persistent change and suppressed activity. This response
has proven effective. NCMA has followed the lead of the Chief Medical Officer of
Health (Ministry of Health) together with guidance from the Ministry of Education
as it applies to our Education programme and EVANZ as it applies to events.

Our pandemic and natural disaster policies are available on request and online.

Current pandemic risk management strategies are addressed in 1.2.1.2.

5.7. Climate Change


  - NCMA is receiving external advice on solar energy in the first quarter of 2023
with the aim of contributing as much to the grid as we draw.

  We regularly review HVAC and heating schedules with the aim of minimising
energy waste.

  We encourage responsible use of paper in both administrative and education
settings, maintaining a sheet music library and utilising technology where
practical.

  We have increased bike parking from 2 to 8 in 2022, and a further 6 spaces are in
construction.

  We are working towards a reliable measure of our carbon emissions.

  We successfully reduce waste through a detailed management plan:

6. Accountability

6.1. Information to be provided to NCC

Strategic Presentation
The Trust will report to a meeting of Council twice annually, presenting:

       - Statement of Financial Performance and Statement of Financial Position,

       Informed assessment of Council funding and support over the reporting
period,

       - Commentary on NCMA’s activities,

       Other such information as the Trustees consider necessary to enable an
informed assessment of performance over the period being reported.

7. Forecast financial information

7.1. Statement of significant assumptions

7.1.1. Introduction


NCMA’s Statement of Intent covers the period 01 January 2023 to 31
December 2025.

The prospective financial statements are based on a realistic forecast of
future events at the time this document was prepared.

7.1.2. Inflation


Forecasts and budgets include an average increase of 10% on revenues and
6% on expenses in the 2023 calendar year when compared with the 2022
budget. In respect of the 2024 and 2025 calendar years an increase of 3%
has been applied to both revenue and expenditure to provide for inflation.

We have assumed a 5% increase in Council grant funding in each year 2023
to 2025, in the context of reported 7.22% inflation nationally in the 2022
calendar year.

Since this document was written Council have released their annual plan
2023-2024 for consultation. In the case Council cannot increase grant
funding by the assumed 5% uplift in grant funding for 2023, NCMA will seek a
commercial line of credit to meet the shortfall.

7.1.3. Opening cash position

In the absence of audited financial data for the calendar year ended, this
document assumes a starting cash position of $151,055 as at 31 December,
2022.


Draft: Friday, 10 February 2023


Page 25 of 31


7.1.4. NCMA Foundation

As at 31 December 2022 $640,657 in funds received in respect of the new
NCMA Foundation Trust are recorded on the NSOM Trust Statements of

Financial Position.
By the end of 2023 those funds will be deposited on the newly established
Trust.


7.1.5. Loan repayments and facility maintenance


In an email dated 1 July 2022, Council’s Group Manager Community Services
asked if remission of existing debt to Council would be welcomed by the
Trust, and for an indication of the outcomes for our community should Council
choose to remit the debt.

The Trust’s response included the following statement:


_For as long as a debt remains, the Trust considers we have an obligation to_
_Council and will act in good faith to ensure repayments are made in a responsible_

_manner._

_However, the Trust would welcome remission of our debt to Council. This would_
_help us save proactively for future capital renewal of our Nile Street Facility,_
_breaking a cycle of historical borrowing for that purpose that has given rise to_
_valid criticism._

_Understanding the provenance of the debt, the Trust considers it appropriate that_
_funds released through remission of our debt are reserved for future capital_
_replacement._

_Debt repayments currently make it hard for the Trust to adequately provide for_
_future capital renewal. Investment will certainly be needed before the term of the_
_current loan expires. Remission of the current debt will empower the Trust to set_
_adequate funds aside for the inevitable._

In that there will be net losses in general funds after depreciation in each year
2023 – 2025, the forecasts presented illustrate the Trust’s position on debt
remission.

III) Governance

i. The Board’s approach:

The NSOM Trust Board is small, but highly experienced and skill specific. After
the rebuild 2013- 2018, when NCMA was operating with a new Director and
minimal staff, the Board worked closely alongside management to mentor
and support staff with inevitable overlap between governance and
management. In 2023, with a full complement of staff and 5 years of
operation, the Board has now stepped back into a more defined governance
role, while continuing to be very available to management in a hands-on role
when requested. The Board has a close relationship with both management
and staff, with joint representation on most subcommittees. In summary, a
close, open, friendly approach, but with respect for and awareness of the
boundaries between governance and management.

Board Priorities for 2023:

`o` Long-term financial sustainability
`o` Staff, Member and venue user experience and wellbeing
`o` Broadening experiences for audiences and students

ii. Performance evaluation

This close-knit Board is in regular contact with each other by phone in addition
to monthly full Board meetings and numerous sub-committee meetings. We
are constantly evaluating our performance and tweaking our direction if
necessary. This includes our relationship with the Council. An annual review of
Board performance takes place mid-year at the same time as staff are
reviewed. Management are invited to contribute to this.
The Board appreciates the opportunity to work closely with the Council when
appointing Trustees and the two most recent 2022 appointments reflect the
quality and collaboration of the recruitment process.

iii. Succession planning

The Board is very aware of the need to plan for succession, especially given its
small size. In 2023 the Board intends to appoint trainee non-voting members
in anticipation of upcoming vacancies. Incoming Board Chairs are targeted a
year in advance and outgoing Chairs continue as Trustees to endure a
satisfactory handover of responsibilities.

iv. Tikanga Māori

During the rebuild, Board members consulted with iwi to ensure the venue was
suitable for toi whakaari Māori and appropriate modifications were made at
their request. The Board embraces te reo Māori, tikanga Māori and the
kaupapa of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and we look for Trustees who endorse this. It is
not a prerequisite, however.
