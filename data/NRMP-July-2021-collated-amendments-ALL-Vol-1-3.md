# **2** **meanings** **of words**

### **MW.i Introduction**

This Chapter defines the meaning of the words used in this Plan and in the Resource
Management Act 1991, unless the context otherwise requires. Where a word is followed
by an asterisk (*), the definition that follows is the meaning provided in the
interpretation section of the Act and is repeated here to assist readers. In the case of
any inconsistency, the statutory definition prevails.

### **MW.ii General rules of interpretation**


a) Any term which is not defined in this section has been used in its common meaning

as defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (11 [th] ed.).

b) Lists of items (for example, conditions, standards and terms in rules) and

subparagraphs within paragraphs are to be read conjunctively, where they are not
otherwise specified.

c) Singular includes plural and vice versa.

d) Headings do not affect the interpretation of this Plan.

e) Cross references are for the assistance of readers and are not necessarily exhaustive.

### **MW.iii Definitions**

**Access** means a practical permanent vehicular and pedestrian access from a formed
road onto a site, either directly, or over another site subject to a registered
easement of right of way appurtenant to the site.


**Accessory building** means a building, the use of which is incidental to that of any other building or
buildings on the site, and in relation to a site on which no building has been
erected, is incidental to any permitted activity on the site. On a residential
site, a sleeping room detached from its residential unit is not an accessory
building.


**Accessway** includes a footpath, walkway or cycleway and each of these terms and their
design requirements are further defined in the Nelson Tasman Land
Development Manual 2019 (NTLDM).


**Acoustic Certificate** means a certificate signed by a qualified acoustic engineer certifying an
Acoustic treatment of a residential unit and specifying a certified level of port
noise within a residential unit.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **2-1**


**Acoustic Certificate**
**Register** means the register kept by the Port Operator that contains a list of all sites
that have an Acoustic Certificate, the date of the certificate and the certified
level of port noise for that site.
**Acoustic treatment** Acoustic treatment means acoustic treatment of a residential unit to achieve
an indoor design level of 40 dBA Ldn within all habitable spaces, either with
ventilating windows open or with mechanical ventilation installed and
operating, when port noise is at or below the certified level of port noise and
shall include the cost of testing and obtaining an Acoustic Certificate; except in
the following circumstances when the above indoor design level does not need
to be achieved:


a) the property owner seeks a form of or level of acoustic treatment or
mitigation that results in a different indoor design level, or,


b) it is impracticable to achieve the specified indoor design level due to
the desirability of maintaining heritage features of a building, and
instead the indoor design level of the habitable spaces will be reduced
as far as practicable, or,


c) it is impracticable to achieve the specified indoor design level in
habitable spaces at a cost of 50% of the value of the property
(excluding land value), and instead the indoor design level in
habitable spaces will be reduced as far as practicable while not
exceeding the cost of 50% of the value of the property (excluding land
value).

land that incorporates the road as well as the land between the buildings and
the road boundary on each side of the road. It creates neighbourhood character
and a shared public realm.


**Structure*** any building, equipment, device or other facility made by people and which is
fixed to land, and includes any raft. For the purposes of structures in the beds
of rivers and lakes, “structures” includes dams and bank protection structures
fixed to the bed.


**Structure Plan** is a mapped framework to guide the development or redevelopment of a
particular area by defining future development and land use patterns, areas of
open space, the layout and nature of infrastructure (including transportation
links), and other key features for managing the effects of development, often
across land in multiple ownership except that in the event that the indicative
education facility in Marsden Valley Schedule I is not developed, then the lack
of an education facility means the subdivision design is still generally in accord
with the Marsden Valley structure plan. See AD11.4A ‘Structure Plans’ for
further information.


**Subdivision*** has the meaning given in the Act.


**Substation** those parts of works or electrical installations, being a building, structure or
enclosure, incorporating fittings that are used for the purposes of the control of
the transformation, transmission, or distribution of electricity, but excluding
electricity distribution substations occupying less than 36m [2] .

takes from a river are considered to have adverse effects.


Once trigger flow for a river (as defined in Appendix 28.2) is reached all takes
must cease, except those for


i) domestic, stock water, or fire fighting purposes, and


ii) water permits, where a water conservation plan has been approved
by the Council.


For more detail see Appendix 28.3.ii.


**Unclassified** **roads** means roads with a hierarchical classification of Sub-Collector, Local Roads and
Residential Lanes. Refer to chapter 4 ‘Transport’ of the Nelson Tasman Land
Development Manual 2019 (NTLDM).


**2-28** **(12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


_**AD10.2.iii**_ _**Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019 (NTLDM)**_

The NTLDM is a document that combines network asset design and construction
requirements for both Nelson and Tasman regions. It is intended to provide consistent
minimum standards and guidance for network assets that Council will accept as part of its
network, and activities affecting them including maintenance and operations. It also
includes formation and construction standards for some private assets that connect to
network assets.


The NTLDM replaces former Engineering Standards, the Nelson Land Development Manual
2010, and the Tasman District Engineering Standards.


The relationship of the NTLDM to asset management functions under the Local
Government Act (2002) and resource management functions of Council under the
Resource Management Act (1991) is important.


All subdivision and development within Nelson and Tasman must be consistent with the
requirements of the respective Resource Management Plans (RMPs), being the Tasman
RMP and the Nelson RMP. Subdivision and development must be consistent with
applicable RMP rules, either by meeting conditions for permitted activities or by applying
for and gaining a resource consent.


However, where a new Council network asset is being created, maintained, or replaced
through development, such as a new road or water supply pipeline, it is the NTLDM that
provides more detailed design and construction standards of what the Councils will
accept and take over as a public asset. Additionally, practice notes provide
comprehensive design details that can support developers and maintenance and
operation contractors in carrying out their activities in a way that will meet Council’s
expectations for design and construction. The NTLDM and practice notes can also aid the
Councils in achieving levels of service that are set out in Long Term Plans and objectives
of the RMP’s.


Parts of the NTLDM are externally referenced provisions of the Nelson Resource
Management Plan or Tasman Resource Management Plan, where specified in those plans.
The specified parts will be subject to First Schedule requirements of the Resource
Management Act as “externally referenced” standards. .


_**AD10.2.iv**_ _**Financial contributions guide**_


Not part of this Plan, but intended to explain financial contributions required under the

plan with worked examples of calculations.


_**AD10.2.v**_ _**New Zealand standards**_


The New Zealand Standards Association publishes a variety of documents on a wide range

of subjects. These documents may be referred to when assessing any application,
imposing conditions of consent, or establishing compliance with the Plan provisions.


_**AD10.2.vi**_ _**Codes of practice**_


Various industry associations publish Codes of Practice relating to their spheres of

interest. Where these documents have wide publication and a measure of support the
Council may refer to them when assessing applications and in imposing conditions of
consent.


_**AD10.2.vii Externally referenced documents**_


Part 3, Clauses 30-35 of the First Schedule of the Resource Management Act 1991

outlines what documents can be incorporated by reference and the process for doing
this. The documents that can be incorporated by reference include standards,
requirements or recommended practices of international or national organisations or
countries and any other written material that deals with technical matters that is too
large or impractical to be printed as part of the Plan. Documents that are incorporated
by reference have legal effect as part of the Plan, have to be consulted on and to be
publicly available.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **3-17**


_**AD10.2.viii New Zealand Urban Design Protocol**_


The Council is a signatory to the NZ Urban Design Protocol. The protocol aims to foster

improvements in the way our towns and cities are designed and developed. By signing
the protocol the Council has committed to an action plan to raise awareness of the value
of quality urban design both to the Council and the community.


**AD10.3** **Additional relevant documents**


_**AD10.3.i**_ _**Documents referred to in the Resource Management Act**_


The Act requires the Council, when preparing or changing a plan, to have regard to

various documents (sections 66 and 74). These are as follows:


_**AD10.3.ii**_ _**Regional policy statement**_


This document has been produced under the Resource Management Act. It provides an

overview of the resource management issues of the region and the policies and methods
to achieve integrated management of the natural and physical resources of the region.
This Plan may not be inconsistent with the Regional Policy Statement.


The Nelson Regional Policy Statement was originally notified in August 1994 and after

hearing of submissions, became operative in March 1997.


**3-17A** **(12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


**This page has been left intentionally blank.**


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **3-17B**


_**AD10.3.iii**_ _**National Environmental Standards**_


The Minister for the Environment can recommend to the Governor-General that a

regulation be issued known as a National Environmental Standard. A standard can deal
with a range of factors, e.g. qualitative or quantitative standards, for example for noise
or contaminants, or can determine methods for implementing standards, or classifying a
resource. They can also prohibit an activity. Where a regulation prohibits an activity,
this prevails over the provisions of a Plan.


_**AD10.3.iv**_ _**Regulations**_


The Governor General may issue regulations at any time concerning a range of issues,

e.g. the manner of content of applications, who is required to be served notice of an
application, and so on. Regulations can apply to specific parts of the region, be applied
generally or from time to time. Where appropriate, these regulations must be taken into
account.


_**AD10.3.v**_ _**National policy statements**_


These may be issued by the Minister for the Environment on matters of national

significance that are relevant to achieving the purposes of the Resource Management
Act. The exception is the NZ Coastal Policy Statement, which was mandatory, and was
issued by the Minister of Conservation 5 May 1994. Any plans produced by a Council
under the Act must not be inconsistent with any National Policy Statement.


_**AD10.3.vi**_ _**Local Government Act 2002**_


The Long Term Plan (LTP) is prepared under the Local Government Act 2002, with the

purpose of describing Council’s activities to promote the social, economic,
environmental and cultural well-being of our community, in the present and for the
future. This includes describing the ‘community outcomes’ of the city, providing
integrated decision making and co-ordinating the resources of the Council. It provides a
long term focus for the decisions and activities of the Council and is an important basis
for the accountability of the Council to the Nelson community. It provides an
opportunity for the public to participate in decisions on activities to be carried out by
the Council and covers ten years of financial expenditure in detail. The LTP also includes
the Council’s Development Contributions Policy. This policy ensures that those who
benefit from (or create the need for) new infrastructure are responsible for funding it.
The Local Government Act requires the Council to take a **sustainable development**
approach through the LTP, which is a wider planning mandate than that of the Resource
Management Act which promotes **sustainable management** of the environment.


A LTP must be adopted every three years and cover a period of not less than 10

consecutive financial years. The Annual Plan is published in the years that the LTP is
not. The Annual Plan updates Council’s financial situation, intended activities and work
programme for the following financial year.


Asset and Parks and Reserves Management Plans are developed for the management of

infrastructure and community facilities assets. These Plans combine multi disciplinary
management techniques (including technical and financial) over the life cycle of the
asset to provide a specified level of service in a cost effective manner.


_**AD10.3.vii Documents recognised by iwi**_


Council will take into account any relevant planning document which is recognised by an

iwi authority, and which has been lodged with Council, to the extent that its content has
a bearing on the resource management issues of the region.


_**AD10.3.viii Reserve management plans**_


The day to day management of reserves under the Reserves Act 1977 is controlled by

management plans under the Reserves Act. This Plan only sets out to manage reserves at
the broadest resource management level, leaving the operational and planning details of
reserves to the reserves management plans. Most reserves have been included in the
Open Space and Recreation Zone or Residential Zone.


**3-18** **(12/11/12) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


b) Grampians slope risk overlay, Tahunanui core slope risk overlay and Tahunanui fringe
slope risk overlay


Indicate where controls are to be imposed in order to address the effects of slope risks in

two broad areas, the Tahunanui Slump and the lower Grampians slip. Both areas define
potential or actual land slip areas where stringent building or development controls are

necessary.

c) Inundation overlay


The Inundation Overlay indicates areas which may be susceptible to localised stormwater

flows, stormwater ponding, ponding of other floodwaters or tidal inundation. The causes
of localised ponding are highly site specific but generally relate to the presence of a low
lying area where stormwater accumulates or tidal backwater effects prevent drainage.
Currently where new development occurs in these areas, the Council requires that
adequate site levels are achieved to maximise drainage and that floor levels are
established above the maximum water level expected in a 50 year return period event
(an event predicted to happen on average only once in any 50 year period).


Tidal inundation may occur at some sites during periods of extra high tides and

particularly in combination with low pressure weather systems. In exposed coastal areas
wave action is also a factor. Calculations of the likely flooding events include sea level
rise of 0.3 m over the next 50 years (after Ministry for the Environment 1993). As
knowledge of possible global warming and associated sea level rise is gained this figure is
likely to be reviewed. The Council is also reviewing the way in which development
adapts to the potential effects of climate change on inundation levels.

d) Flood path overlay


Indicates areas where the land may be subject to occasional flooding within flood paths

and overflow channels of rivers and streams. These areas have been differentiated from
the inundation overlays because of the higher risks to safety and property associated
with this type of hazard, particular from the erosive or destructive force of moving
floodwater. The Council is undertaking a long term programme of upgrading storm water
drainage. As this work progresses the susceptibility of areas to flooding will change.
Those purchasing or developing within the Flood Path Overlays should obtain the most up
to date information available from the Council.

e) Flood overlay


Indicates areas in the Rural Zone and Conservation Zone where land may be subject to

flooding or hazards caused by running water such as debris flows on steam fans and the
change in the position of creeks, but insufficient information is available to allocate it to
the Inundation Overlay or Flood Paths Overlay.


The Flood Overlay is an advisory overlay which is given effect to through other rules in

the Plan, the Resource Management Act itself or through other legislation. Examples of
situations where the Flood Overlay will be taken into account include the earthworks
rules of the Plan which make earthworks within the Flood Overlay a restricted
discretionary activity, section 14 of the Resource Management Act which controls the
damming or diversion of water, and the Building Act which takes flood hazards into
account when assessing a building consent.


**AD11.3.2** **Landscape overlay**


All areas adjacent to the city, coast and main traffic routes which are highly sensitive to

development. They comprise mainly the ridge tops together with the most sensitive
shoulder slopes.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/11/12)                                       3-23**


**AD11.3.3** **Services overlay**


**AD11.3.3.i** The Services Overlay relates to the availability and capacity of services such

as wastewater, water supply, stormwater drainage, and roads. The overlay areas
contain one or more of the following servicing constraints:
a) Development of the area is beyond the immediate scope of the Long Term Plan or
Council’s Nelson Development Strategy.
b) The area is low lying and requires filling before servicing can occur
c) The area is one where extension of services is required to serve other land or
contribute to a network. This includes the provision of legal road and utilities up to
the boundary of the development site to serve the development potential of
adjoining land in the Services Overlay.
d) Services in the area are inadequate and require comprehensive upgrading before
development can proceed
e) The area is above the contour for which water can be supplied to meet the

requirements of the Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019 (NTLDM). (The
standards are based on the NZS4404: Land Development and Subdivision, and the
New Zealand Fire Service Water Supplies Code of Practice).


These constraints must be addressed before development of these areas can proceed.

Resource consent will not be declined for servicing constraint reasons when they have
been resolved.


**AD11.3.3.ii** The Services Overlay also deals with situations where services need to be

developed in the area in a comprehensive manner in conjunction with the Council and
other property owners.


**AD11.3.4** **Heritage overlays**


**a) Heritage Buildings, Places, and Objects**


Are individual items, described in Appendix 1, and indicated on the Planning Maps. The

Plan protects these items.


**b) Heritage Precincts**


Are areas that contain a number of heritage items, where the group together has

particular value. Heritage Precincts may contain buildings that are not listed heritage
buildings, but are subject to controls to ensure that alterations to these buildings do not
detract from the values of the precinct.


**c) Heritage and Landscape Trees**


Are individual trees, groups of trees, or woodlands, described in Appendix 2, and

indicated on the Planning Maps. The Plan protects these items.


**d) Archaeological sites**


All sites of human habitation prior to 1900, indicated on the Planning Maps and

supplemented by Appendix 3. The Plan protects these items.


**e) Archaeological Overlay**


Are areas which are known to contain a high number of identified archaeological sites,

and which are also likely to contain many sites that are not documented. One such area
occurs at Delaware Bay, another at the mouth of the Whangamoa River. Within these
overlays the Plan regulates activities which have the potential to damage archaeological
sites. Individual sites within these overlays are not shown on the Planning Maps, but
records of some archaeological sites within them are available at the Council offices.
Applicants will be expected to establish the presence or absence of archaeological sites
near their proposed activity through consultation with the relevant iwi, and where
necessary in some cases through an archaeological investigation.


**3-24** **(12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


Land use planning, particularly the creation of new roads, walkways and cycleways
through subdivision and development, and the location of nodes of activity through zoning
and associated rules, have potential to influence the sustainability of the land transport
system. The Council encourages the co-location of activities through land use planning
which can encourage a shift from vehicle dependence to the increased use of cycling,
walking and passenger transport.

**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO10.1.1.i** The direct effects of vehicle traffic, such as noise, vibration, exhaust
fumes, and vehicle crashes, and the indirect effects such as loss of privacy, loss of land
for other uses, and separation of neighbourhoods, can all be avoided or mitigated by a
reduction in the number and length of vehicle trips through creating highly accessible
communities. Dependence on the private motor vehicle also has indirect effects such as
the risks associated with a community’s reliance on fossil fuels, Nelson’s carbon footprint
and impact on climate change, and the associated demands for greater roading
infrastructure. These indirect effects can also be avoided or mitigated through
encouraging mixed use and more intensive development at appropriate locations. See
also policy DO14.3.1 (roading) under ‘Services’ and policy DO13A.2.1 (accessibility) under
Objective DO13A.2 ‘improving connections’.


**Methods**


**DO10.1.1.ii** Promote the use of public transport, cycling and walking as
alternatives to the use of cars.
**DO10.1.1.iii** Promote travel demand management activities such as car pooling
and travel management plans.
**DO10.1.1.iv** Provide in the Plan for urban consolidation, by zoning and regulating
the development of new greenfields subdivisions, and allowing a higher density of
dwelling units in areas within walking distance of shopping areas and transport nodes,
including The Wood and the Stoke Centre.
**DO10.1.1.v** Regulating the construction of new state highways, arterial roads and
principal roads.

**policy**
**DO10.1.2** **road network**

_**The road network should be maintained and developed to accommodate a range of**_
_**road types to support a range of functions and streetscape characteristics.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO10.1.2.i** The adverse environmental effects from roads can be avoided or
mitigated through creating and maintaining a mixture of road types that accommodate a
range of traffic volumes, speed environments, functions and users. A hierarchical road
network provides for the safe and efficient movement of traffic by assigning some roads
(state highways and arterial roads) a primary role of carrying through traffic and a
minimal role in providing access to properties, and by assigning other roads (local roads)
a primary role in providing access to properties and a minimal role in carrying through
traffic.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/11/12)** **5-39**


**DO10.1.2.ii** The hierarchy is as follows, listed in descending order of importance
for through traffic and ascending order of importance for property access: state highway,
arterial road, principal road, collector road, local road. Different classifications of road
require different design treatment appropriate to their function. For example, while
reverse manoeuvring from sites onto Unclassified Roads is encouraged, it is not considered
appropriate on Classified Roads for safety and efficiency reasons.
**DO10.1.2.iii** Adverse environmental effects from roads are avoided or mitigated
by diverting traffic away from local roads to roads higher in the hierarchy, and by ensuring
the road network maximises connections between appropriate roading types. The greater
traffic volumes that can be carried by arterial roads promote energy efficiency as well as
more efficient use of time. Local roads, by being relieved of through traffic, are able to
provide valuable areas of open space, residential amenity and promote active modes of
travel. The hierarchy will minimise delays and accidents and makes best use of the
substantial investment in the road network.
**DO10.1.2.iv** The location of activities on the network also affects road efficiency
and safety and should be regulated. The travel demand management approach of the
Regional Land Transport Strategy seeks to improve road efficiency and reduce
environmental effects of vehicle transport by encouraging a road network that supports
intensification and mixed use developments in appropriate areas and the accessibility of
public transport, cycle and walkway based transport networks within those areas.


**Methods**


**DO10.1.2.v** Develop and maintain a hierarchical road network, using the road
classifications above.
**DO10.1.2.vi** Indicate the road hierarchy on the Planning Maps.

_**New roads and intersections should integrate with the adjoining road network while**_
_**not adversely affecting the environment, or the safety or efficiency of the road**_
_**network.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO10.1.3.i** New roads and intersections need to be designed and located in such
a way that any impacts on the road system and the environment are kept to within
acceptable limits. See also policy DO14.3.1 (roading) under ‘Services’ and policy
DO13A.2.1 (accessibility) under Objective DO13A.2 ‘improving connections’
**DO10.1.3** . **ii** New development should connect well to existing, indicative,
proposed or potential development in adjacent areas to facilitate interconnection
between new and existing communities. A development with poor links to the
surrounding area creates an enclave which encourages movement to and from it by
private motor vehicle rather than by other modes. Road connections to existing areas
should ensure that outcomes of the connections, such as increased traffic volumes, will
be commensurate with the design of those areas. Connectivity between new and existing
areas should endeavour to enhance and contribute toward a more sustainable community
overall, wherever practical.

**DO10.1.4** **traffic effects of activities**

_**Activities should be located and designed to avoid, remedy or mitigate the effects**_
_**of traffic generation on the road network and encourage a shift to more sustainable**_
_**forms of transport.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO10.1.4.i** The safety and efficiency of the road can be adversely affected by
parking, access and pedestrians associated with a particular activity. Safety, efficiency
and accessibility are paramount when planning transport in Nelson. The location of
appropriate land uses alongside the appropriate elements of the network will result in
fewer accidents and greater efficiency.
**DO10.1.4.ii** For local roads, the location of employment, shopping and
recreational activities relative to housing areas affects the demand for travel. There are
positive effects to be gained from co-locating these activities, such as the reduction in
travel demand and the ability to more easily use forms of transport other than private
motor vehicles. These effects may take many years to be achieved through land use
planning policies but it is an important consideration when assessing the traffic effects
of activities


**Methods**


**DO10.1.4.iii** Rules retaining discretion on activities with high effects on traffic on
Classified Roads.
**DO10.1.4.iv** Rules requiring parking, loading, and manoeuvring to be

**DO10.1.5** **access to sites**

_**Every site should have an access that provides safe entry and exit for vehicles from**_
_**the site to a road (except for defined sites in the City Centre), without compromising**_
_**the safety or efficiency of the road network, the safety of different types of road**_
_**users or the streetscape values.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO10.1.5.i** Vehicle access to sites has transport implications because of the
potential for conflict between pedestrians, cyclists and road traffic and vehicles entering
and leaving sites. Access points need to be designed and located in such a way that
impacts on the road system are acceptable for the particular type of road serving the
site, its users and the land use activity. In particular the pedestrian/vehicle conflict needs
to be minimised through encouraging slow speed access and high visibility at the footpath
and accessway interface. Access and manoeuvring design needs to be appropriate for the
road classification. Access to sites should not significantly reduce passive surveillance
(i.e. the ability to overlook the public space from the adjoining private activity)
opportunities in the streetscape. See also policy DO14.3.1 (roading) under ‘Services’ and
policy RE3.5 (streetscape) in Chapter 7 Residential Zone. See also rule ICr.32, Inner City
Zone.

gradient, and surface, and visibility to and from the road, having regard to the number,
and types of vehicle that will use the access and the road, the number of pedestrians
using a road, the design speed of the road and any intentions to reduce speeds.

**DO10.1.6** **parking, loading, and turning**
_**Sites should provide on site parking, loading, turning for vehicles, or have access to**_
_**those facilities sufficient to avoid any adverse effects on the safe and efficient**_
_**operation of the roading network as appropriate to the type, function and speed**_
_**environment of the road being accessed. Any use of off-site facilities shall not**_
_**compromise pedestrian, cycle or vehicle safety, or the safe and efficient operation**_
_**of the road network.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO10.1.6.i** In order to minimise potential hazards created by traffic movement
and traffic generation it is important that each site fronting a classified road provides
adequate space on site so that parking, loading, and manoeuvring of vehicles can be
contained within the boundaries of the site. Reverse manoeuvring onto unclassified roads
will be encouraged to avoid the need to accommodate large paved turning areas in the
front yard and to create a slower speed environment on the road. The arrangement
should not lead to a hazard to vehicle traffic or pedestrians. See also policy DO14.3.1
(roadings) under ‘Services’.


**5-41A** **(12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


**DO10.1.6.ii** This policy will mean different amounts of on-site parking for
different activities, relative to their location and scale. For instance residential activities
on unclassified roads will be encouraged to use the road for manoeuvring to create a slow
speed environment and avoid the inefficient use of front yard space for sealed
manoeuvring areas. See policy RE3.5 (streetscape) under Chapter 7 Residential Zone.

_**pedestrians, cyclists, public transport and motor vehicles.**_
_**b) a variety of logical and effective connections between different transport**_

_**networks and between different parts of the city and urban areas.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO13A.2.1.i** A well designed transport network integrated with land use improves
accessibility and mobility, contributes to better quality of life, encourages healthier
lifestyles, uses less non-renewable energy, and contributes to improved economic
performance. Interconnected street systems can also enhance safety, reduce crime and
fear of crime.  Note: The term ‘pedestrians’ includes people with disabilities and in
wheelchairs or on mobility aids

_**where appropriate, multiple use of natural environment connections, particularly**_
_**from the hills to the coast, utilising rivers, streams and natural catchment features**_
_**through urban environments to enhance native biodiversity.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO13A.2.2.i** Nelson is characterised by its distinct natural topography, dramatic
coastal landscape setting and relationship to the harbour and sea. Providing connections
between the hills and the coast reduces the impact of urban areas and urban expansion
on the connectivity of these two environments. Connections to the hills and the coast
also enhance the identity of urban neighbourhoods/communities and dictates growth
patterns for urban areas and infrastructure. Connections between natural areas are also
beneficial for natural values.

_**and encourages interaction and safety.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO13A.2.3.i** Lack of connections to, and buildings that turn their backs on, public
spaces can lead to poor quality, under utilised and unsafe public environments. Civic
spaces, neighbourhood and local reserves, esplanade reserves and streetscapes benefit
from being well connected and overlooked by private spaces and buildings. This creates
safe, attractive and secure public spaces and pathways and provides environments that
encourage people to become more interactive with the community.

#### **objective** **DO13A.3 creating high quality public spaces**


_**Buildings, reserves and roads that are created as part of subdivision and development result in quality**_
_**public spaces that are beautiful and inspiring, provide for and enable social, cultural, economic and**_
_**environmental wellbeing and enhance amenity values.**_


**Reasons**


**DO13A.3.i** High quality public spaces enable people to play, relax and socialise
throughout various levels/scales of the urban environment (suburbs, commercial villages,
city centre), support recreational and commercial activity, and help to ensure vitality of
public spaces and communities. Conversely, poor quality public spaces are an inefficient
use of resources, are under-utilised and are a burden on ratepayers.

Public spaces in urban areas are owned and maintained by the community and need to
be located and developed in a manner that represents quality urban design. Private
development that adjoins public spaces will need to demonstrate an appropriate level of
quality urban design reflective of the prominence and function of the adjoining public
space. Subdivision and development creates new public spaces (roads, reserves, parking
areas, public accessways) so these need to be designed and relate to their context to
ensure they are able to be developed as high quality spaces. Public spaces which are
prominent and which are intended to have a high level of public use are deserving of
inspirational design. Left over sections of land, or areas unable to be developed due to
gradient, stability or other reasons, are not considered suitable for public spaces unless
they are capable of accommodating a range of the values sought in objective DO13A.3.

_**use.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO13A.3.1.i** A range of parks, reserves and streetscapes are to be provided
throughout the urban area that are accessible and well used by the community and
contribute to quality of life. The activities of subdivision and development provide
opportunities for reserves and streets to be designed and located in such a way that they
become quality public spaces that residents use and value. The activities of subdivision
and development on land adjoining public spaces also provides opportunities to ensure
that private development acknowledges through design the adjoining public space.

**DO13A.3.2.i** The Council will encourage designs for public spaces that create win
win situations, enabling a range of environmental, economic and social/cultural benefits
to be achieved. An example of this approach is the design of an esplanade reserve that
has both ecological benefits through its design width and planting, and also provides
benefits for the adjoining suburban neighbourhood in terms of amenity, recreation,
accessibility and connectivity, and low impact stormwater opportunities. Quality urban
design also treats streets and other thoroughfares as positive spaces with multiple

_**public use, should represent outstanding architectural and landscape design, and**_
_**be socially, culturally and environmentally responsive. Design should consider the**_
_**needs of present and future generations.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO13A.3.3.i** Public buildings and important urban spaces should express a level
of design appropriate to the prominence of the site within the city, or relationship of the
site to the urban fabric, or end public use. Such context specific, creative, urban design
supports a dynamic urban social and cultural life, makes admirable towns and fosters
strong urban identities. Depending upon the landscape significance of the site, the

**Reasons**


**DO13A.4.i** Desirable towns and cities offer opportunities for all people of the
community, from young to old, people on different incomes and people of many cultures.
Subdivision and development design should recognise that the benefits of urban life are
widely shared. The physical location and diversity of development helps to build a strong
and sustainable community.

_**now and in the future.**_
_**c)**_ _**a range of building types to provide accommodation and offer opportunities for**_
_**all groups within the community.**_
_**d) a range of subdivision layouts that contribute to a diversity of neighbourhood**_

_**types and identities.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO13A.4.1.ii** Quality urban design enhances the social, environmental and
cultural qualities of our environments by delivering a mix of houses, uses and facilities
that the community needs. Adaptability of buildings and sites to accommodate a range
of activities over their lifetime or as the local environment changes (such as the ability
for neighbourhood commercial or service activities to set up in greenfield areas once the
residential neighbourhoods are established) enables vibrant, and sustainable
communities. Diversity in building form and subdivision layout contributes to
neighbourhood identity, and assists to build a strong sense of community.

**Explanation and reasons**


**DO13A.5.1.ii** To be an environmentally responsive city Nelson must manage
resources to take account of the needs of present and future generations. This includes
constantly seeking ways to minimise adverse impacts on human health and natural and
cultural systems, including air and water quality, minimising waste production, energy
and water use, and maximising the efficiency of land use and infrastructure. The items
listed in this policy are some of the many ways of ensuring that subdivision and
development design are environmentally responsive and these will be considered when
assessing consent applications for subdivision and development that departs from
minimum standards.


**Methods**


**DO13A.5.1.iii** Rules and assessment criteria.
**DO13A.5.1.iv** Provide free advice to applicants on a range of eco building options.

#### **objective** **DO13A.6 urban design process**

_**Sustainable management of Nelson’s urban resources achieved through quality urban design processes.**_
_**These processes holistically manage urban systems and interconnections rather than focusing on the**_
_**effects of individual activities.**_


**Reasons**


**DO13A.6.i** Urban design is an approach that draws together many sectors and
professions, and it includes both the process of decision making and the outcomes of
design. To achieve quality urban design, quality design approaches need to be employed.
It is important that this is considered at the start of the land conversion/development
process and that the outcomes are managed in an integrated way across property
boundaries, neighbourhoods and zones.

**policy**
**DO13A.6.1** **policy and administration**

_**Quality urban design should be supported through flexible and responsive policy**_
_**and administration systems that use a holistic approach to the management of**_
_**urban environmental effects.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO13A.6.1.i** Prescriptive policy and disjointed administration systems cannot
support quality urban design proposals. The interconnected nature of urban
environments, and the effects of development within them, requires a balanced
approach to considering the effects of individual activities on a whole project scale. This
approach recognises that trade offs may be required in some situations to achieve the
multiple goals of quality urban design.


**Methods**


**DO13A.6.1.ii** Rules and assessment criteria, particularly the restricted
discretionary residential subdivision rules **.**
**DO13A.6.1.iii** Implement Appendix 14 Residential Subdivision Design and
Information Requirements.
**DO13A.6.1.iv** Use of the Major Projects Team to review significant development
proposals.
**DO13A.6.1.v** Review internal Council systems and processes to remove barriers
and encourage integrated decision making.
**DO13A.6.1.vi** Undertake interdepartmental projects.
**DO13A.6.1.vii** Encourage the use of pre-application consultation between
applicants and Council officers.
**DO13A.6.1.viii** Create an Urban Design Panel to provide design advice on private
and public projects.

**policy**
**DO13A.6.2 coordinated approaches**

_**Subdivision and development should use a coordinated multi disciplinary approach**_
_**to avoid the adverse effects and cumulative adverse effects of managing urban**_
_**resources individually and from a single discipline’s perspective.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO13A.6.2.i** Creating quality urban design requires action across a wide range of
sectors, groups and professions relative to the nature and scale of the application.
Professionals in all disciplines (in private and public arenas) need to work together, as
no one profession can understand the full complexity of Nelson city and urban areas.

**DO13A.6.3 collaboration**


_**To encourage the collaboration of the private and public sector where there are**_
_**opportunities for projects to assist with the Council’s role of achieving a quality**_
_**urban design vision for the community in a sustainable and equitable manner.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO13A.6.3.i** A commitment to the community, and relationships at a local level,
will begin to change the patterns of development which represent poor quality urban
design. The use of collaborative relationships to develop social and recreational facilities
for the community, and for the upgrading of servicing infrastructure is well established.
Collaboration is needed to start addressing the provision of quality urban design, and
also to start addressing issues of developing land and buildings for other urban uses.


**Methods**


**DO13A.6.3.ii** Promotion of and participation in community housing projects where
appropriate.
**DO13A.6.3.iii** Ensure Council development projects are pursued in partnership
with iwi and the community.
**DO13A.6.3.iv** Implement actions and partnerships identified in the Central City
Strategy.
**DO13A.6.3.v** Create and implement an Urban Design Panel and Major Projects

**policy**
**DO14.2.1** **allotments**

_**The pattern created by subdivision, including allotment sizes, shapes, and**_
_**dimensions should take into account the range of future potential land uses and the**_
_**development potential of the area, and any potential adverse effects on the**_
_**environment and amenity values, and the relationship of the allotments to any**_
_**public open spaces (including reserves and streets).**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO14.2.1.i** In rural areas the size and scale of rural allotments should relate
principally to the provision of services, the likely potential density of dwellings and other
buildings, the versatility of soils for present and future use, and effects on amenity values
of the area.
**DO14.2.1.ii** Subdivision for other purposes, including land used for conservation,
recreation, or cultural facilities, should be undertaken in a manner that reflects the
natural character or the cultural values of the facilities, and the likely public needs
associated with them.
**DO14.2.1.iii** The subdivision of land for residential purposes should create
allotments which are of sufficient size and shape to enable dwellings erected upon them
to have usable outdoor space and to allow development at a density which is appropriate
to the character of the particular area. The density patterns reflect the objectives and
policies for living areas, with higher densities (and hence smaller lot sizes) permitted in
The Wood and near the Stoke Centre. The policy also provides the ability to undertake
higher density building where the development of units is part of a comprehensive plan.
**DO14.2.1.iv** The subdivision of land for all types of future land uses should have
regard to the orientation and location of allotments to reserves and streets. The pattern
and density of subdivision should allow for future buildings to overlook public spaces, and
allotments for roading should provide generous frontages to reserves to avoid adverse
safety and amenity affects.

#### **objective** **DO14.3 services**


_**The provision of services to subdivided lots and developments in anticipation of the likely effects and**_
_**needs of the future land use activities on those lots within the developments and the development**_
_**potential of other land in the Services Overlay.**_


**Reasons**


**DO14.3.i** Subdivision and development of land is usually followed by intensification
and changes in land use that increase the demands on the infrastructure of the City. It is
appropriate for servicing requirements to be addressed at the time of subdivision or
development to ensure that efficient and effective (including cost effective) systems are
provided or enhanced and to ensure that the additional costs of servicing do not fall on
the community generally.

**DO14.3.1** **roading**
_**Subdivision and development should provide for:**_
_**a) The integration of subdivision roads with the existing and future road network**_

_**in an efficient manner, which reflects the function of the road and the safe and**_
_**well-integrated management of vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, and**_
_**b) Safe and efficient access to all lots created by subdivision and to all**_

_**c)**_ _**Roading connections as shown on Structure Plans and/or as described in**_
_**Schedules in the NRMP, and**_
_**d) Avoidance or mitigation of any adverse visual and physical effects of roads on**_

_**the environment, and**_
_**e) Public to private space relationships and roading design that represents a high**_

_**quality urban streetscape, and**_
_**f)**_ _**The road network requirements to support the access and connectivity of future**_
_**developments on other land in the Services Overlay.**_
_**g) The road network required to service the subdivision or development in**_

_**accordance with a) to e) above shall be funded and constructed by the consent**_
_**holder and vested in Council as part of the development. Provision of the**_
_**necessary road network in (f) shall be funded by the Council, if the project is**_
_**provided for in the LTP. In this case, the relevant works have to be constructed**_
_**prior to the section 224(c) certificate being sought for the development. In all**_
_**other cases it is expected that the necessary roading shall be funded by the**_
_**consent holder (with costs shared between benefiting landowners, where**_
_**relevant).**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO14.3.1.i** Subdivision and development has the potential to result in a number
of effects on the road network, including:
a) Potential to change the function and efficiency of the road network through an
increase in vehicle numbers and changes in travel patterns.
b) Demand for new roads which are not able to be constructed or maintained in an
economically sustainable manner justified by the development yield it serves.
c) Changes to the function and connectivity of local roads which may lead to adverse
effects on major routes, such as collector roads, principal arterials and state
highways.
d) Potential adverse effects on stormwater quality and quantity.
e) Changes to streetscape and the formation of, and relationships with, public spaces
which can lead to poor amenity and urban design outcomes.
f) Inability to provide a well connected and efficient transport pattern.
**DO14.3.1.ii** Vehicle ownership levels mean that vehicular access must generally
be provided to newly created lots. Road and access standards must reflect anticipated
volume, function, connections, streetscape and relationship to public spaces values.
Roads and access must integrate into the existing and future road system to provide safe,
convenient, and efficient movement throughout Nelson. Subdivision requirements for
roads and access need to provide for the development of a variety of systems for vehicle,
passenger transport, cyclist, and pedestrian movement. Roads can also have major
visual, stormwater and other effects and should be located and designed as far as possible
to enhance the environment and minimise any adverse visual and other effects on
topography, landscape and amenity values. Roads adjoining public spaces should be
designed to directly relate to that space through the provision of sufficient frontage,
landscaping, parking and, where possible, maximise efficient use of resources between
the two public spaces, such as combined stormwater collection, treatment and disposal
mechanisms.
**DO14.3.1.iii** When subdivision or development takes place, regard must be had to
the likely future roading requirements of adjacent or nearby land, to avoid the land
becoming ‘land-locked‘, or inaccessible. If an adequate alternative is not available, the
subdivision and development will be required to vest a legal road which is located in such
a position and is of sufficient width, to provide suitable access to adjacent or nearby
land.


**5-70** **(31/10/13) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


Subdivision and development is required to vest legal road to provide connectivity to
adjoining land with development potential.  The cost of creating this connection at the
time of subdivision shall either be funded through the LTP or funded by the developer.
There may be circumstances whereby roading is funded and constructed by way of cost
sharing agreements amongst landowners.
**DO14.3.1.iv** Road and access requirements on subdivision and development are
also addressed in DO14.1.3 (orderly development), DO 13A.2 (improving connections),
DO13A.3 (creating quality public spaces) and Chapter 6 (Financial Contributions). Land
transport, including cycleways and walkways are dealt with under DO10.1 (land transport)
as well. Structure Plans are a further method to provide integration to road, walkway
and cycleway linkages.


**Methods**


**DO14.3.1.v** Rules in each zone and some overlays, controlling subdivision and
development in relation to access to the road network; road design and alignment; site
access, servicing, turning and parking; and transport, motor vehicle, pedestrian and cycle
linkages.
**DO14.3.1.vi** Assessment criteria on applications.
**DO14.3.1.vii** Use of financial contributions (Chapter 6) and/or LTP development
contributions to acquire or upgrade vehicle, passenger transport, pedestrian, cycling and
amenity linkages where appropriate and not otherwise provided by the subdivision or
development (note: these may also be provided by means other than financial
contributions). The Council’s Nelson Development Strategy will inform the prioritisation
of the works and projects facilitated through the LTP to ensure development occurs in a
sustainable manner.

_**i)**_ _**All wastewater, water and stormwater infrastructure specified in Chapters 5,6**_
_**and 7 of the Nelson Tasman Land Develop Manual 2019 to become public shall**_
_**be vested in Council.**_

_**The costs of additional new or upgraded infrastructure shall be paid for by the**_
_**developer, or as part of the development.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO14.3.2.i** Water supply, stormwater disposal, wastewater treatment and
disposal, street lighting, electricity and telecommunications services are important for
the well being of people and communities and for their health and safety. The systems
need to be reliable, and provide agreed levels of service, while avoiding adverse effects
on the environment. Where reticulated services are not available, then special
consideration of the possible adverse environmental effects on the future activities on
the land is needed. New underground reticulation of electricity and communication
systems is required in all zones (except the Rural and Conservation Zones) to avoid
adverse visual and amenity effects, and contribute towards improved streetscapes.
**DO14.3.2.ii** When subdivision and development takes place, regard must be had
to the likely service needs for the future development of adjacent or nearby land. It is
generally more economic and efficient to install services with sufficient capacity for
growth at the time of the initial development and provide the ability for these services
to be taken to the boundary, rather than to have to upgrade services at a later date. In
some circumstances, a later upgrade may be impracticable or impossible due to the
location or prior development of the area.
**DO14.3.2.iii** Infrastructure and services requirements on subdivision and
development are also addressed in AD11.3.3 Services Overlay, DO14.1.3 (orderly
development), Chapter 6 (Financial Contributions) and the LTP Development
Contributions Policy. Council’s Nelson Development Strategy will inform the prioritisation
works and projects facilitated through the LTP to ensure development occurs in a
sustainable manner.

_**proceed where:**_
_**a) it will result in significant adverse effects, or**_
_**b) the services listed in policy DO14.3.2 cannot be provided.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO14.3.3.i** Development and subdivision in unserviced or poorly serviced areas
has potential to have adverse effects on the amenities of the area and on health and
safety. The urban and Rural Zone High Density Small Holdings areas where there are
greatest difficulties with servicing are shown on the Planning Maps as a Services Overlay.
In other rural areas, on site services may be satisfactory.
**DO14.3.3.ii** The Council has developed a Long Term Plan to fund the servicing of
parts of the urban area according to a timetable. As this proceeds, subdivision and

#### **objective** **DO14.4 network utilities**


_**Efficient use of network utilities infrastructure while avoiding, remedying, or mitigating the adverse**_
_**effects of utilities on their surrounding environments.**_


**Reasons**


**DO14.4.i** The growth of the Nelson community has resulted in the development
of a significant network utility infrastructure to support the community. It is important
that efficient use is made of this infrastructure of network utilities as they are often
significant community assets. While network utilities are in many cases essential to the
community, it must be recognised that they can generate adverse effects on the
environments surrounding them. It is appropriate that the adverse effects of network
utilities be minimised.

**policy**
**DO14.4.1** **efficient use of network utilities**

_**Management of network utilities that promotes their efficient use.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO14.4.1.i** In most cases existing network utilities represent a considerable
investment and are substantial community assets. It is appropriate that these assets be
used and developed in an efficient manner. This is in line with the intentions of Section
7 of the Resource Management Act 1991 in relation to physical resources.

**policy**
**DO14.4.2** **transmission lines**

_**Reduce the potential risks associated with high voltage transmission lines by**_
_**encouraging the location of these away from urban areas and by ensuring**_
_**residential development is not located near such lines.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO14.4.2.i** The network utility operators that utilise high voltage transmission
lines recognise that there is some potential for adverse effects arising from the proximity
of these lines to residential development. The effects of concern are the potential health
effects of electromagnetic fields and other practical safety concerns. It is appropriate
that the Plan enforce established safety distances from this type of network utility.


**Methods**

**policy**
**DO14.4.3** **effects of network utilities**

_**Ensure that the adverse effects of network utilities on the surrounding environment**_
_**are minimised.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO14.4.3.i** Network utilities have the potential to cause adverse effects on the
environment surrounding them. Many network utilities involve the use of visually
obtrusive structures or the generation of electromagnetic radiation or fields. Any
development of new or existing network utilities should minimise the potential adverse
environmental effects of the utilities on the surrounding environment.


**Methods**

#### **objective** **DO14.5 community services and facilities**


_**Appropriate provision for community services and facilities in the district.**_


**Reasons**


**DO14.5.i** The provision of community services and facilities such as parks,
amenity, open space, and sports, cultural and recreational facilities is an important
aspect of the wellbeing of people and communities. Such provision is a means of avoiding,
remedying or mitigating adverse effects of changes in, and continued growth of, the
district. It is appropriate that this is addressed whenever subdivision and development is
taking place as such changes result in changed, and usually increased, requirements for
such services.


**5-74** **(12/11/12) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


**DO18.1.1.ii** A minimum flow does not mean that flows will not sometimes
naturally fall below this level. The minimum flow reflects the probability of a flow
reaching that level, whether that is on average once a year (mean annual low flow) or
once over a five year period. The aim is to avoid taking water out of these waterways
during these very low flows to avoid causing extra stress for instream life. Minimum flow
levels vary depending upon the management objectives established for each water body.
These objectives are listed in the table in Appendix 28.2.
**DO18.1.1.iii** Trigger flows have also been set. When flow levels drop to this level,
all non-essential abstraction from that river are suspended, except where an approved
‘Water Conservation Plan’ exists.
**DO18.1.1.iv** Wai (water) will be the starting point for the development of Iwi
environmental indicators, using the Maitahi (Maitai) River as a case study.  The literature
review recently carried out as part of the Council initiated study of the Maitai will provide
a resource for the Iwi indicators project.

**policy**
**DO18.1.2** **flow regimes: other rivers and streams**
_**Manage water flows and levels in other rivers and streams not specified in Appendix**_
_**28.2 through allocation limits on resource consents.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO18.1.2.i** Minimum flow regimes or trigger flows have not been established for
rivers and streams not specified in Appendix 28.2. Many of these water bodies are located
in the Conservation Zone or in rural areas and contain high quality water and significant
ecological communities. In addition, these rivers and streams are generally not under
any pressure from water users, and are unlikely to be subject to abstraction in the future.


**Methods (for policies DO18.1.1 and DO18.1.2)**


**DO18.1.2.ii** Rules controlling water takes during periods of low flow.
**DO18.1.2.iii** Assessment matters for resource consent applications.
**DO18.1.2.iv** Monitoring of flow levels.
**DO18.1.2.v** Timely information to water users about current flow levels and

**DO18.1.2.vi** Increase awareness of rural areas where water shortages are likely
to occur.

**policy**
**DO18.1.3** **increased demands for water**

_**Address increased demand for water created by population growth.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO18.1.3.i** This policy recognises that the population for the Nelson City Council area is
expected to increase by 24% from 2001 to 2021. This has significant implications
regarding increasing demand for out-of-stream uses of water.
**DO18.1.3.ii** Increased demand for water in both the urban and rural zones means that a
number of measures will be necessary to avoid the cumulative effects of that population
growth on water resources.
**DO18.1.3.iii** The Council recognises that as the city grows there will be an
increased demand for water from the Maitai and Roding rivers. While the Council will be
able to continue to meet the minimum flows established in the urban supply resource
consent, the opportunities to leave more water in the Maitai and Roding rivers will reduce
as urban water supply demands increase. For this reason, and in recognition that water
is a precious resource, the Council will promote efficient use of water, rainwater storage,
and water reuse.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/11/12)** **5- 97**


**Methods**


**DO18.1.3.iv** Actively monitor water permits and instream flows, to ensure that:
a) consent conditions are adhered to, and
b) sufficient residual flows remain to provide for in-stream values, and
c) water is returned to the source where it is no longer needed for abstraction, and
d) accurate information is held on what water permits are held but not used, particularly
for over-allocated rivers.

**DO18.1.3.v** Meter all consented water takes.
**DO18. 1.3.vi** Continue to monitor river flows and set up new monitoring sites,
where necessary, to improve data flow.
**DO18. 1.3.vii** Set up a website to advise users of flow levels.
**DO18. 1.3.viii** Limit most water permits to 10 years to allow for regular review of
allocations.
**DO18.1.3.ix** Change the conditions on existing water permits which do not meet
allocation limits specified in Appendix 28.2 (refer to Policy DO18.3.1(b)).
**DO18.1.3.x** Require rainwater storage for new residential units in rural areas.
**DO18.1.3.xi** Promote efficient use of water, rainwater storage, and water reuse

**FCi.2** The Resource Management Act 1991 enables the Council to obtain financial
contributions to avoid, remedy, mitigate, or offset adverse effects relating to activities.
Financial contributions can relate to activities permitted by the rules, or can be a
condition of any consent.


**FCi.3** The Act requires the Resource Management Plan to establish the
circumstances when a financial contribution may be imposed, the methods that will be
used, the purpose of the provisions, and the general purposes for which the financial
contribution may be used. A financial contribution may be in the form of money, or
land, or a combination of both.


**FCi.4** During the course of preparing the Plan, the definition of ‘financial
contribution’ in the Act was amended to include only money and land. Previously, the
term had also included works and services. This chapter now relates to Financial
Contributions and also to works, services and other related matters that the Council may
impose as conditions on consents.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (01/09/04)** **6-1**


**FCi.5** In addressing actual and potential adverse effects, the Nelson City Council
provisions for financial contributions may comprise:
a) payment of a standard financial contribution in money for off site adverse effects
associated with specified activities.
b) payment of a variable financial contribution in money, land, or both for additional
off site adverse effects associated with some types of activities that cause
additional adverse effects.
c) in some limited circumstances, the exemption as of right, or the reduction at the
discretion of the Council, of financial contributions.
d) in some limited circumstances, the opportunity to pay a financial contribution in
money or land, to offset adverse effects on the environment.


**FCi.6** The provisions in the Plan comprise a combination of rules which spread the
costs of activities between those directly benefiting from undertaking new activities
(particularly subdivision and development) and the wider community. The provisions aim
to ensure that a fair proportion of the costs of avoiding, remedying, or mitigating the
actual and potential adverse effects on the environment arising from new activities, is
charged against the activity. Consequently, the wider community will not have to pay
unduly for effects which result in private benefit.


**FCi.7** Developers will be expected to meet the total costs of work and provide
land directly related to a new activity. They will also be expected to make a
contribution towards upgrading the existing community infrastructure, both to underpin
the development and address adverse effects. In some cases this will require provision
of new services.


**FCi.8** Because Nelson is an integrated and compact geographic area, contributions
will generally not be varied on a geographic basis. However, the provisions of the Plan
are such that distinctions can be made, in terms of financial contributions, between a
subdivision that is able to connect directly to services and one that is not.


**FCi.9** Financial contributions will generally be obtained in the following
circumstances:


a) on all new subdivisions resulting in the creation of additional allotments; and on
the basis of a flat rate for infrastructure and a value-related rate for reserves


b) on all new developments involving a building consent above $60,125 value, on the
basis of a percentage for infrastructure and reserves


c) on activities requiring a resource consent, as appropriate in the circumstances in
order to address the adverse effects of the activity


d) on activities requiring specified water and/or trade waste connections, involving
water consumption and/or trade waste discharge, at a rate related to the size of
the water connection


**FCi.10** The amount of the standard financial contribution is based on the concept
that new activities should contribute to funding infrastructure, reserves, and community
services necessary to avoid, remedy, or mitigate the adverse effects arising from their
establishment.


**FCi.11** The Council has developed a ten year strategy to meet the community’s
anticipated requirements over this period. It is the aim of the Council to ensure that a
fair and reasonable share of the additional cost of providing infrastructure, reserve, and
community services associated with new activities is obtained through financial
contributions. The remainder of the additional cost of upgrading facilities, together with
the cost of maintaining facilities required by the District, will be met by the community
through the usual funding avenues such as rating.


**FCi.12** The share of financial contributions to be contributed on subdivision and
development has been determined in accordance with this strategy as fixed sums to be
paid in accordance with the policy and rules in this chapter of the Plan. The amount of
the fixed sums initially specified in the Plan will be increased annually, indexed to
inflation (see FCi.5(b)).


**6-2** **(12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


b) shall be treated in exactly the same way as a new building, and subject to the
provisions set out in FC2.4.ii and iii.


c) Works required to maintain a Heritage Building, as defined in the Plan, shall be
exempt from a financial contribution under Item 6 in Table FC2.4.1.


d) Where building consent is required following a subdivision consent, and where the
financial contribution required under Table 1 has either been reduced or was
exempt, the same reductions and exemptions that applied at subdivision stage
shall apply equally at building consent stage, providing the position with regard to
the supply of services to the site has remained the same.


e) Network utility structures (as defined in FC2.1) shall be exempt.


**FC2.5** **Trade wastes and water supply**


**FC2.5.i** A financial contribution in money shall be paid to the Council of the
amounts set out in Table FC2.5.1 (and adjusted in terms of FC2.9) for every industrial or
commercial activity that requires a new or increased capacity for connection to the
Council’s reticulated water supply system. This financial contribution is a condition on
any permitted activity and on any resource consent.


**FC2.5.ii** The purposes of the financial contribution shall be for the Council’s
reticulated water supply and sewerage systems and shall be levied according to the
diameter of the water connection serving the activity.

**FC2.7** **Resource consents**


**FC2.7.i** A financial contribution may be required as a condition on a resource
consent to provide money, land or a combination of both; and a condition may be
imposed to undertake works (other than as a financial contribution), for one or more of
the following purposes:
a) to avoid, remedy, or mitigate an adverse effect of the activity on the environment
b) to ensure a positive effect on the environment to offset any adverse effect
c) to implement the objectives and policies of the Plan
d) to extend, widen or upgrade roads, (including intersections, footpaths, berms, and
kerb and channel) on land or roads in the vicinity
e) to extend or upgrade the stormwater, water supply, and sewer systems and any
other necessary services to the boundary of each allotment of any land being
subdivided
f) to provide on site parking, access, loading and manoeuvring areas
g) to create esplanade reserves or esplanade strips, other than on subdivision
h) to provide for erosion and sediment control
i) to plant trees, shrubs and ground cover and provide landscaping, to revegetate
land that has been cleared, or to enhance amenity values
j) to recover costs associated with additional works paid for under FC2.7.vi


**FC2.7.ii** Any financial contribution will be the full amount required to achieve the
purpose of the financial contribution.


**FC2.7.iii** Any financial contribution or condition, under FC2.7.i (d) in the case of
roads will be one or more of the following:


a) the necessary land and works to construct, widen or upgrade any new or existing
road, where:
i. roads are not available, or
ii. existing roads are of inadequate width or construction to cater for increase

usage caused by the subdivision or development, or
iii. alterations or works to existing roads are required for traffic safety or

efficiency as a consequence of the subdivision or development.


b) the necessary land and works to access any other land in the vicinity of the land
being subdivided or developed, or adjacent to the road being constructed,
widened or upgraded, to provide for the effective future development of the other
land. (Additional land or works beyond that required as a direct consequence of
the subdivision or development may be required under this paragraph. See
FC2.7.vi.


c) payment by the consent holder to the Council of the full cost of (a) or (b) or both,
where the Council will do some or all of the work or provide land.

|REr.31.4<br>a) the proportion of the front yard to be contained by the fence and<br>whether the objectives of an open, high amenity, pleasant and safe<br>streetscape can still be achieved, and<br>b) the design and appearance of the fence (including physical<br>dimensions), materials and colour of the fence and whether this<br>provides a pleasant, human scaled streetscape, and<br>c) whether any site specific circumstances exist that result in the<br>need for a higher solid front fence for safety of the residential<br>occupants and/or animals or to reduce noise effects from<br>Classified Roads on residents, and<br>d) the  relationship of the fence with the dwelling, garage, and<br>driveway on the site and the cumulative effects of those elements<br>on the streetscape, and<br>e) the degree to which landscaping between the fence and the road<br>boundary mitigates the visual effects of solid fences, and<br>f)     the degree of surveillance when viewed from public spaces and<br>the consistency with the outcomes sought in policy RE3.5 and<br>DO13A.3.1 and<br>g)    the topography of the site and whether that mitigates the fence<br>height encroachment effects on streetscape and/or reserve<br>amenity, residential character and surveillance and safety.|<br>REr.31.5<br>The concept of open frontages onto roads, walkways and<br>reserves is promoted.  A sense of openness between<br>residential properties and streets, reserves and walkways is<br>required to maintain streetscape amenity, encourage a sense<br>of community, provide opportunities for passive surveillance<br>and improve safety in public spaces.<br>The requirements of REr.31.1 a) to b) relate to the entire front<br>yard i.e. the section of side boundaries that are within the front<br>yard. In some circumstances multiple rules may apply,<br>particularly where boundaries adjoin a reserve or walkway and<br>are also within the front yard. On boundaries adjoining a<br>walkway or reserve rule REr.31.1(c) applies rather than<br>REr.31.1 (a or b).<br>The rule provides for different degrees of height and visual<br>permeability for classified and unclassified roads in recognition<br>of the different function, traffic effects and privacy needs of the<br>residents living in that street.<br>Fences on boundaries between properties are limited in height<br>to avoid having a dominant effect, keep them human scaled,<br>and to maintain a level of openness while providing for privacy.<br>Development, including front fences, should not perpetuate<br>existing patterns of design and layout that are not valued<br>development patterns, nor representative of the urban design<br>outcomes sought in the Plan.

While<br>landfills generally involve earthworks and modify the shape of the land, their<br>primary purpose is the disposal of solid waste.  The concentration of solid<br>waste, often containing contaminants, within landfill sites, increases the<br>potential for adverse effects on the environment beyond that associated with<br>normal earthworks.  Additional adverse effects may include generation of<br>leachate, discharge of gas, geotechnical issues such as poor bearing<br>strength and settlement, and contamination of the land itself making it<br>unsuitable for other uses.<br>Some landfills operate as cleanfill sites, accepting only material that does not<br>undergo any physical, chemical, or biological transformations likely to cause<br>adverse environmental effects, or health effects, once it is placed in the<br>ground.

Subdivision (General).|REr.108.5<br>Subdivision in the Services Overlay provides specific services<br>related assessment matters in addition to those that would be<br>applied to a subdivision consent application under REr.107<br>General.  For subdivision in the Services Overlay, subdivision<br>consent is only required under REr.108, unless any other<br>overlays also apply to the site.<br>Subdivision in the Services Overlay is a restricted discretionary<br>activity rather than a controlled activity.  This provides a<br>limitation on the range and type of conditions that can be<br>imposed, relevant to particular sites and circumstances.  It also<br>allows the option of declining a subdivision if the site or the<br>development is unsuitable or servicing of the site is considered<br>unsustainable for Council.<br>The areas defined on the Planning Maps include areas where<br>the provision of services to subdivisions is not straightforward.<br>There may be constraints on the capacity of existing systems.<br>The area may need filling in order to get the necessary fall for<br>stormwater or wastewater drainage. Special regard also has to<br>be had to the roading pattern, to avoid precluding future<br>development of other areas, as well as ensuring that the<br>capacity of services has regard to the development potential of<br>neighbouring land.<br>In other cases, the area may be above the contour to which the<br>Council can supply water, where the landowner would have to<br>provide their own supply.  Such situations are a discretionary<br>activity.  The Council wishes to avoid a proliferation of small<br>individual systems, and will be looking for proposals that<br>integrate with other developments, and have the ability to<br>serve a wider area.  Since the Council often ends up<br>maintaining these systems, ongoing operating and<br>maintenance costs are important.<br>There are also areas where services can be supplied, but<br>where additional conditions may apply eg. an additional<br>financial contribution towards the cost of a special water<br>supply, or special conditions regarding the point where the<br>public supply may be accessed.<br>Refer to Policy DO14.3.1 Roading and DO14.3.2 Drainage,<br>Water and Utilities for direction in terms of when Council will<br>fund infrastructure provision to sites, or when the infrastructure<br>provision shall be funded by the developer.<br>The Council holds copies of maps which define the servicing<br>constraints in more detail.<br>(Note: The capacity of the drain or wastewater network means<br>the capacity of the length of the drain from the site to, and<br>including, its outfall to a water body, coastal water or treatment<br>facility).|

**U.6.2** **Vegetation removal**
The damage, destruction or removal (modification) of any vegetation located within the
open space area within the Marsden Plateau Landscape Area shown on Figure 2 that does
not comply with the permitted activity standards is a Discretionary Activity.


**U.7** **Non-complying activities**
i) Any other activity in the Marsden Plateau Landscape Area not listed as permitted,
controlled or discretionary is a non-complying activity.
ii) Applications for subdivision and earthworks that do not comply with the Restricted
Discretionary Activity standards will be assessed as Non-Complying Activities.


**U.8** **Assessment criteria**

In making a decision whether to grant consent, and impose conditions, the following
assessment criteria are relevant.

**U.8.1** **Subdivision layout**


i) The extent to which the proposal acknowledges and complies with the concept in
Figures 1 and 2 and promotes the protection of the special landscape values of the site.


ii) The ability of the design to achieve an urban form that works in harmony with the
natural environment patterns that exist in the Marsden Plateau Landscape Area. The
proposed design shall be responsive to existing significant vegetation, landform features
and patterns, and site constraints.


iii) The extent to which the street system maximises connectivity and permeability in
order to promote convenience, social interaction, and to enhance user safety in the
street and security of property. Refer also to connectivity criteria in U.8.3, U.8.6 and
U.8.7.


iv) The ability for the design to provide rear or side access lanes to provide garage access
away from the road front, reduce use of rights of way, and possibly to assist with future
redevelopment opportunities.


v) The extent to which each allotment has road frontage. Right of ways should be limited
and only be used to reach pockets of land that are inaccessible by road, and would
require streams to be piped, vegetation cleared, or the topography is too steep to
facilitate a road or where numbers of dwellings to be accommodated off the access do
not justify a road.


vi) The ability of the design, orientation and layout to contribute to energy efficiency of
the development.


vii) The degree of variation in the lot density within the Schedule U site.


viii) The degree of compliance with Appendices 10, 11, 12 and the matters in Chapter 4
of the Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019 except where specific alternatives
are provided to address environmental and landscape values of the site and assessment
criteria in this schedule, through design.


ix) The degree to which the subdivision facilitates good urban design for resultant site
development.


x) The actual of potential effects of the activity on the special landscape values of the
Marsden Plateau as the backdrop to the City, especially when viewed from public spaces
and Stoke, Monaco and the Airport.


xi) The relationship of design to future adjoining urban development, open space
linkages, and its ability to integrate and promote efficiency.


xii) Financial contributions.


xiii) Any assessment criteria for other relevant rules in the Residential Zone rules tables
or in Schedule U.8.2 to U.8.8.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **7-131**


**U.8.2** **Services overlay**


i) The ability for the site to integrate with the City’s services infrastructure, and future
urban expansion, in a sustainable manner that avoids, remedies or mitigates any risks to
human health, or the environment, natural hazards, or adjoining properties.


ii) The extent of the use of low impact stormwater methods.


iii) The extent to which stormwater runoff is reduced by limiting permeable surfaces and
including permeable road and parking surfaces where possible.


iv) The degree to which the design provides for the improvement in the quality of
stormwater before it reaches streams by allowing it to flow through stormwater
treatment devices including, but not limited to, grass areas (such as swales, rain gardens)
and through constructed wet areas. Note that these devices may also allow for
stormwater flow attenuation.


v) the matters in the Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019.

**U.8.3** **Road design**


i) The extent to which the design provides for connectivity of neighbourhoods and the
whole site as it is progressively developed. Note: a means of assisting to achieve this is
through use of the roading standards for the Marsden Plateau Landscape Area in Table 1
of this schedule.


ii) The visual effects of roading location and materials. The alignment of roading should
follow the contour to be responsive to the site and less obtrusive. Roading materials and
colours that reduce visual impact should be considered in the design.


iii) The extent to which the roading design provides for safe streets which combine the
movement of private vehicles, cycles and pedestrians.


iv) The provision of narrower carriageways where low traffic flows are anticipated, to
help slow and calm traffic, but providing enough width for safe and efficient access to
adjoining land.


v) The use of street trees to connect to open space, reduce adverse landscape effects
and enhance visual amenity.


vi) The extent to which the proposed lighting provides for pedestrian purposes without
significant adverse visual effects at night when viewed from various public spaces, in
particular parts of Stoke, Monaco or the Airport.


vii) The extent to which devices and systems are put in place to mitigate any adverse
effects that may be created by both the quality and quantity of stormwater runoff from
road areas.


viii) The ability of the design to provide for car parking in association with the look out
area required as part of the open space development. The car parking can be located
within or separate from the carriageway.

**U.8.4** **Earthworks**

i) The extent to which the design avoids adverse landform modifications which would
disturb the natural character of the area or visually sensitive areas.
ii) The assessment criteria in REr.61 Earthworks.
iii) The likely presence of and disturbance to any archaeological sites.

**U.8.5** **Building**


i) Demonstration of how the building is to be integrated visually with the site and its
relationship to public open space through responsive architectural design, colour and
landscaping. In particular, the ability of landscaping to integrate the building visually
especially when viewed from public spaces and Stoke, Monaco, and the Airport.


**7-132** **(12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


significant landscape role as the backdrop to the City, they should be incorporated into the
design of the subdivision to achieve an integration of natural and built environments. For
this reason specific rules, assessment criteria and roading standards have been developed
to assist with the integration of development with the landscape, and its ability to
acknowledge natural systems and to enhance residential amenity. The roading standards in
Table 1 can be used for the Marsden Plateau in lieu of those contained in Chapter 4 of the
Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019 as they directly relate to the assessment
criteria for development within this Schedule. The proposed roading standards are in Table
1 along with definitions detailing the intended use of each road type.

The major modification of sites and their landform/landscape for subdivision can result in
residential areas resembling many other suburbs and lacking in character and individuality.
Where there are specific landscape values, as exist on the Marsden Plateau Landscape
Area, a design that is responsive to the receiving environment will result in distinctiveness,
connectivity to surrounding suburbs, and respect for a landscape. Subdivision should aim to
develop a new neighbourhood’s identify by connecting it with the underlying landform and
ecosystems, which in turn will integrate the subdivision with the landscape protecting
those visual values associated with the Marsden Plateau.


**U.10** **Marsden Plateau Structure Plan**

Figures 1 and 2 in Schedule U illustrate the Site Analysis and subsequent Structure Plan
that has been adopted through the careful consideration of the site opportunities and
constraints for development. The objective of the Structure Plan is to provide an outline
within which subdivision and development can occur in a manner that acknowledges the
significance of the Marsden Plateau landscape and will ensure that this landscape is
integrated, protected and enhanced.

Figure 1 Site Analysis Plan illustrates the various site opportunities and constraints that any
future development proposal will be required to demonstrate consideration of. This is to
be evaluated through the assessment criteria in U.5 above. The Site Analysis Plan also
provides the reader with a greater understanding of how the Structure Plan in Figure 2 has
been created.

The Structure Plan has resulted from the identification and analysis of the many factors of
the site that, combined with the assessment criteria, will ensure any resultant subdivision
design will conform with natural systems and integrate with the landscape that is valued as
part of the backdrop to the City. The Marsden Plateau has visual and landscape values
from various vantage points particularly in the Stoke, Monaco and Airport areas, but also
provides a gentle slope with minimal stability issues, and generous views of Tasman Bay
suitable for high quality residential development. A range of medium to low density
development is considered suitable for the plateau but only where it can be offset visually
through open space and vegetation to minimise adverse environmental effects, particularly
landscape effects.

**U.10.1** **Figure 2: Key and definition of zoning types**

Schedule U provides for a range of densities to be developed on the Marsden Plateau in
recognition of the preservation and vegetation of the open space foreground which will
integrate the development with the landscape, and enable such densities to make efficient
use of a gently sloping land resource without significant adverse effects on the valued
green backdrop to the City and views from various public spaces, in particular parts of
Stoke, Monaco and the Airport. The densities provided for are those which are considered
to be appropriate for the site given the open space area offset, and the assessment
criteria within the schedule. It may however be that a higher or lower density, or
development form that is different to that of residential dwellings can also be
accommodated on the site while retaining the landscape values sought for the backdrop to
the City. The ability for such higher or lower density to be accommodated will be
dependant upon design, and may also involve a greater or lesser degree of open space.
However, for the purpose of Schedule U, the above densities relate specifically to the


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **7-135**


Structure Plan in Figure 2 which directs the location of such development within the site.

The density categories below (as used in Figure 2) have specified minimums which trigger
associated subdivision rules, however it is anticipated that a range of densities within
each Area (Low to Medium Density Residential and Low Density Small Holdings) will be
created as it will not be possible to achieve the minimum consistently throughout the
Area due to topographical features and the need to comply with various assessment
criteria within the Schedule.


Medium Density Residential (minimum 400m [2] )
Low Density Residential (minimum 1000m [2] )
Low Density Small Holdings Area (see Rule RUr.78)


**U.11** **Marsden Plateau roading standards**

The landscape and visual qualities, combined with the topographical restrictions, size of
the development area, the densities intended to be achieved, relationship to open space
and the stormwater design considerations have resulted in the following three road types
being appropriate to safely and efficiently serve the Marsden Plateau Area, in a manner
that is both efficient and environmentally responsive.

**Major residential road (serving over 20 residential lots)**

Major residential roads are to be vested in Council ownership. Their purpose is to provide
both vehicle and pedestrian access between residential clusters linking to the roading
network extending from Marsden Valley Road. Carriageway widening on small radius
bends and traffic calming measures shall be encouraged and individual lot access
minimised to aid in providing a safe and efficient environment for all users including
motor vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians.

**Minor residential road (serving up to 20 residential lots)**

Minor residential roads are to be vested in Council ownership. Their purpose is to
distribute vehicle and pedestrian traffic from the major residential roads to residential
lanes and individual lots within the residential clusters. It is important to maintain twoway access on these roads whilst keeping vehicle speeds low to minimise the dominance
of motor vehicle movements and ensure the safe operation of the road for all users.
Carriageway widening on small radius curves and traffic calming measures shall be
encouraged.

**Residential lane (serving up to 20 residential lots)**

Residential lanes are to be vested in Council ownership and are to be connected to either
a minor or major residential road at each end. Their main purpose is to provide access to
either rear lots or the back of single depth lots with frontages onto major or minor
residential roads. A secondary function of the lanes is to provide maximum integration
within the public roading network at low design speeds. For these reasons it is considered
beneficial to create low speed single lane access with opportunities for vehicles to pass
at regular intervals.


**7-136** **(31/10/13) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


**policy**
**IC1.4** **access - ring road**


_**Activities which have the potential to generate a high number of vehicle trips or**_
_**heavy vehicle usage should locate with safe direct or indirect access to arterial or**_
_**principal roads (as defined on the Planning Maps).**_


**Explanation and Reasons**
**IC1.4.i** The ring road, and Vanguard and St Vincent Streets are designed to carry
higher traffic volumes. The policy aims to have activities with high potential traffic
impacts locating on either side of the ring road or on Vanguard or St Vincent Street.
Access from other roads is to be restricted to locations in the Fringe where there are not
significant impacts on the functioning of those roads.


**Method**
**IC1.4.ii** Rule requiring large scale retail activity to locate with access to, or close
to, the ring road. Assess other sites on their merits via the resource
consent process.


**policy**
**IC1.5** **maintenance of traffic routes**


_**The operation of activities should not compromise the safe and efficient operation**_
_**of the roading system, in particular the ring road.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**
**IC1.5.i** The ring road is the primary access around and to the City Centre.
Preservation of the function of that road is vital to the success of the City Centre,
otherwise development will tend to drift to areas better served by traffic routes. This
may involve controlling the number or location of access points.


**Method**
**IC1.5.ii** Rules controlling number of access points according to the roading
hierarchy (i.e. major arterial/principal street/collector road etc).


**policy**
**IC1.6** **parking**


_**Within the City Centre parking will be provided publicly in parking areas defined for**_
_**that purpose, in locations which enhance vehicle and pedestrian access, and**_
_**provision of private parking will be voluntary but will be regulated to support**_
_**Policy IC1.3 (access – city centre), Policy DO10.1.1 (environmental effects of**_
_**vehicles) and Objective IC2 (street and public amenity).**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**IC1.6.i** Land in the City Centre is a scarce resource. Collective provision of car
parking means that 100% of individual sites can be developed, making better use of the
land resource. It also makes more efficient use of car parks. Car parking in central
squares also increases the accessibility of the City Centre and ties the area together as
an entity. Separate car parks tend to cause disaggregation of an area, and detract from
the streetscape and amenity objectives being sought. Individual sites can provide parking
voluntarily, but this is not a requirement. Where such parking is provided, a maximum
level applies (equivalent to the minimum level required in zones where parking is
mandatory).


~~**IC1.6.ii**~~ _Clause IC1.6.ii has been deleted to give effect to Policy 11 of the National_
_Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020._


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **8-5**


**Methods**
**IC1.6.iii** Maintain existing differential rates within the City Centre, with the Council
providing collective parking in the City Centre.
**IC1.6.iiiA** Rules setting maximum parking ratios within the City Centre.
**IC1.6.iiiB** Rules controlling private carparking areas.
~~**IC1.6.iv**~~ _Clause IC1.6.iv has been deleted to give effect to Policy 11 of the National_

_Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020._
**IC1.6.v** Resource consent process to consider departure from the parking rules.
**IC1.6.vi** Regular parking surveys in the inner city to monitor the demand for and
availability of on-street and public car parks.


**policy**


**IC1.7** **compactness/consolidation - city centre**


_**Infill development and consolidation within the City Centre will be encouraged, to**_
_**provide an environment that is easily walked from one extent to the other.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**IC1.7.i** There is scope for intensification of development within the City Centre,
including infill of gaps, eg. in Trafalgar Street. Any development would have to be
compatible with the other policies set for the City Centre, eg. in terms of noise, and
traffic generation. Such development would enhance the vitality and viability of the
area and assist the achievement of a compact centre with a subsequent concentration of
activities. Concentrating activities around the Squares and the main streets with access
to them, aims to make efficient use of these parking areas, thereby reducing traffic
flows elsewhere in the City Centre.


**Methods**
**IC1.7.ii** Control building coverage only by reference to daylight admission and
similar controls.
**IC1.7.iii** The Council to act as facilitator through strategic purchase and
redevelopment of land.
**IC1.7.iv** Develop new car parking squares which will provide the focus for
redevelopment around them.


**policy**


**IC1.8** **pedestrian circulation - city centre**


_**Activities at ground floor level in the main pedestrian areas of the City Centre**_
_**should be attractive and interesting to pedestrians, and should promote rather than**_
_**inhibit the flow of pedestrian traffic.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**IC1.8.i** This policy seeks to avoid things such as blank or uninteresting frontages, or
a row of such frontages which collectively discourage pedestrian circulation along
streets. The intention is to avoid “dead” areas which detract from the pleasantness of
the whole City Centre and which can lead to activities seeking to relocate outside the
City Centre.


**IC1.8.ii** Gaps created when buildings in the main streets are demolished and not
rebuilt can be unsightly and can also disrupt the flow of pedestrians by breaking up or
isolating areas.


**Methods**
**IC1.8.iii** Rule requiring transparent glass frontages on the ground floor of main
pedestrian areas and squares, and restricting the use of solid roller security
doors.
**IC1.8.iv** Rule preventing residential activity on ground floor.


**8-6** **(12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


**Methods**
**IC5.3.ii** Rule requiring loading and manoeuvring to be contained on site.
~~**IC5.3.iii**~~ _Clause IC5.3.iii has been deleted to give effect to Policy 11 of the National_

_Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020._
**IC5.3.iv** Monitoring of traffic volumes and impacts, and response as appropriate.

|---|---|
|ICr.29.4<br>a)<br>The appearance of the building.|ICr.29.5<br>The rule aims to ensure that the majority of building frontage on<br>the key pedestrian roads is glazed to provide pedestrian interest.<br>This rule replaces the “retail frontage” concept of previous District<br>Schemes, and avoids the need to name particular activities that<br>can locate on these roads.  Rather, the approach focuses on<br>maintaining an interesting pedestrian environment, irrespective of<br>the activities within the buildings.|

They can also detract from the streetscape and<br>atmosphere of the City Centre, conveying a siege appearance.<br>The rule therefore provides for transparent screens, doors or<br>similar structures, as of right. Devices that do not allow a through<br>view will be assessed as a discretionary activity.|

The nature and scale of the activity and associated parking demands from<br>employees and visitors/customers;<br>ii. Proposed means of managing parking demands, such as;<br>• Managing the number of motor vehicle trips to and from the activity by<br>encouraging higher vehicle occupancies<br>• Sharing parking spaces between complementary uses and spreading<br>peak loads<br>• Encouraging more use of public transport, walking and cycling<br>iii.

This is because frontage continuity, and<br>pedestrian circulation, is more important in this area and because<br>the Parking Squares provide a level of collective loading.<br>However, Appendix 10 (Ap10.6) limits the time period when<br>loading can be made from certain streets, in order to avoid traffic<br>congestion.<br>Reversing onto the ring road is not allowed for safety and<br>efficiency reasons.

It<br>provides a number of mechanisms to achieve this protection<br>including the taking of esplanade reserves and strips.<br>The river and coastal margins on the Planning Maps and in<br>Appendix 6, Table 6.2 (riparian or coastal areas with priority<br>values), have been identified as containing riparian values in<br>accord with section 229 of the Act. In some cases riparian<br>protection already exists, or special circumstances exist,<br>which make the taking of esplanade reserves or strips<br>unnecessary.  In other cases a lesser width, or an alternative<br>way of achieving riparian protection may be more<br>appropriate.  In these situations, a discretionary consent<br>application is needed, in order to depart from the standards<br>set out for a normal subdivision.<br>Where a subdivision is discretionary, and the allotment<br>adjoins any river or the coastal margin, then an esplanade<br>reserve or strip may be required as a condition of the<br>subdivision consent, having regard to the values identified in<br>Appendix 6, Table 6.1 (riparian and coastal margins with<br>identified riparian values).<br>The minimum ground levels set are based on the best<br>estimates from the Ministry for the Environment for likely sea<br>level rise caused by global climate change.  This takes<br>account of predicted spring tides and expected tidal surges,<br>and their consequent effects on stormwater ponding.<br>Sites below the minimum levels stated for controlled activities<br>will be assessed individually to ensure that ground or floor<br>heights are sufficient to protect the site from inundation.<br>See Rule SCr.48 (earthworks) where a site is being filled.|

The key findings of the guidelines was that there<br>are no established health effects from exposure to radiofrequency<br>fields as long as they comply with the New Zealand Standard NZS<br>2772.1:1999 Radiofrequency Fields: Part 1 – Maximum Exposure<br>Levels 3kHz-300GHz.<br>The Council is to be notified of location and nature of any proposed<br>facility.

Subdividers should note that the<br>proposed allotment should be capable of accommodating a<br>building or an activity which complies with the rules in this<br>Zone.<br>The controls also enable consideration to be had to the<br>development potential of nearby land, so that the level of<br>servicing provided is appropriate to the likely future demand<br>in the area.  This allows consideration of future roading<br>patterns, and demands on sewers and other services, to<br>avoid the need for costly and disruptive upgrading later.<br>The Act states the preservation of the natural character of the<br>river and coastal margins to be matters of national<br>importance.  This includes public access along these, and<br>protection of areas of significant indigenous flora and the<br>habitats of indigenous fauna, contained within them. It<br>provides a number of mechanisms to achieve this protection<br>including the taking of esplanade reserves and strips.<br>The river and coastal margins on the Planning Maps and in<br>Appendix 6, Table 6.2, have been identified as containing<br>riparian values in accord with section 229 of the Act. In some<br>cases riparian protection already exists, or special<br>circumstances exist, which make the taking of esplanade<br>reserves or strips unnecessary.  In other cases a lesser<br>width, or an alternative way of achieving riparian protection<br>may be more appropriate.  In these situations, a discretionary<br>consent application is needed, in order to depart from the<br>standards set out for a normal subdivision.<br>Where a subdivision is discretionary, and the allotment<br>adjoins any river or the coastal margin, then an esplanade<br>reserve or strip may be required as a condition of the<br>subdivision consent, having regard to the values identified in<br>Appendix 6, Table 6.1.<br>The minimum ground levels set are based on the best<br>estimates from the Ministry for the Environment for likely sea<br>level rise caused by global climate change.  This takes<br>account of predicted spring tides and expected tidal surges,<br>and their consequent effects on stormwater ponding.<br>Sites below the minimum levels stated for controlled activities<br>will be assessed individually to ensure that ground or floor<br>heights are sufficient to protect the site from inundation.<br>See Rule INr.54 (earthworks) where a site is being filled.<br>In the Nayland South industrial area, a special rule has been<br>imposed to ensure a landscaped bund is constructed when<br>subdivision occurs on land adjoining the residential zone.  A<br>similar subdivision rule has been imposed on the residential<br>zone.  The purpose of the landscaped bund is to ensure the<br>Nayland Road South industrial area can coexist alongside a<br>residential zone.|

These activities are<br>perceived to be a health concern to some people living near them.<br>In developing the rules on radiofrequency exposures, Council has based its approach on that<br>recommended in the “National Guidelines for Managing the Effects of Radiofrequency<br>Transmitters” produced by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry for the Environment in<br>December 2000.  The key findings of the guidelines was that there are no established health<br>effects from exposure to radiofrequency fields as long as they comply with the New Zealand<br>Standard NZS 2772.1:1999 Radiofrequency Fields: Part 1 – Maximum Exposure Levels<br>3kHz-300GHz.<br>The Council is to be notified of location and nature of any proposed facility.  Should this<br>predictive report anticipate and should exposure levels be greater than 25% of the New<br>Zealand Standard level, monitoring to determine the actual exposure levels from the<br>transmitting installation will be required.<br>The rule contains an exception for domestic radiofrequency transmitting equipment.

This rule provides an<br>opportunity for evaluation of such effects when new housing is proposed in proximity to these<br>lines (see also RUr.44 for new lines). All buildings, structures, plant and excavations are also<br>required to comply with NZECP 34 2001 for Electrical Safe Distances.  In some situations,<br>depending upon the length of span and operating temperature of the line, a greater separation<br>distance than is provided for in the rule may be necessary.

Some latitude is provided for the removal of trees in the road reserve<br>if it can be shown it places an unreasonable restriction on the roading network,<br>recognising that the primary purpose of the road reserve is transportation.|

The<br>rock resource is of great value to the community generally.<br>New buildings are incompatible with quarries in that they cover the resource and make<br>it physically more difficult to access. Residential units are especially incompatible with<br>the effects of quarrying, including noise, vibration dust and the effects of heavy<br>machinery and transport both on site and on nearby roads. It is likely that residents will<br>find these effects unacceptable and this will tend to inhibit the utilisation of the rock<br>resource.

|RUr.85.4<br>a)<br>whether the disposal of storm water or  wastewater from the site, or<br>supply of water, can be done effectively without risk to human health or<br>the environment, natural hazards or adjoining properties.<br>b)<br>the matters in the Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019.<br>c)<br>the assessment matters in Rule RUr.78.4 (Subdivision: General).<br>d)<br>the timing of the development in relation to the availability of roading<br>and servicing connections.<br>e)<br>the extent to which the development is provided with services of<br>adequate capacity to serve the future development level of the site and<br>surrounding sites.<br>f)<br> the financial costs to Council (including operation and maintenance<br>costs) of providing water and wastewater services to the development.<br>g)<br>whether the building or development can provide for on site servicing<br>for the building or development in accordance with FWr.12, FWr.14,<br>FWr.25 and FWr.29.|<br>RUr.85.5<br>Subdivision in the Services Overlay provides specific services related<br>assessment matters in addition to those that would be applied to a<br>subdivision consent application under RUr.79 General.  For subdivision<br>in the Services Overlay, subdivision consent is only required under<br>RUr.85, unless any other overlays also apply to the site.<br>Subdivision in the Services Overlay is a restricted discretionary activity<br>where it proposes to connect to public reticulated  This provides a<br>limitation on the range and type of conditions that can be imposed,<br>relevant to particular sites and circumstances.  It also allows the option of<br>declining a subdivision if the site or the development is unsuitable or<br>servicing of the site is considered insufficient or unsustainable for<br>Council.<br>On site servicing will be considered as a discretionary activity.<br>The areas defined on the Planning Maps include areas where the<br>provision of services to subdivisions is not straightforward or where the<br>allotment size, topography and orientation mean that it will be difficult to<br>accommodate on site wastewater treatment and disposal.  There may<br>be constraints on the capacity of existing systems, or the area may need<br>filling in order to get the necessary fall for stormwater or wastewater<br>drainage. Special regard also has to be had to the roading pattern, to<br>avoid precluding future development of other areas, as well as ensuring<br>that the capacity of services has regard to the development potential of<br>neighbouring land in the Services Overlay.<br>In other cases, the area may be above the contour to which the Council<br>can supply water, where the landowner would have to provide their own<br>supply.  Such situations are a discretionary activity.  The Council wishes<br>to avoid a proliferation of small individual systems, and will be looking for<br>proposals that integrate with other developments, and have the ability to<br>serve a wider area.<br>There are also areas where services can be supplied, but where<br>additional conditions may apply eg. an additional financial contribution<br>towards the cost of a special water supply, or special conditions<br>regarding the point where the public supply may be accessed.<br>Refer to Policy DO14.3.1 Roading and DO14.3.2 Drainage, Water and<br>Utilities for direction in terms of when Council will fund infrastructure<br>provision to sites, or when the infrastructure provision shall be funded by<br>the developer.<br>The Council’s Infrastructure Division holds copies of maps which define<br>the servicing constraints in more detail.<br>Note: The capacity of the drain or wastewater network means the<br>capacity of the length of the drain from the site to, and including, its outfall<br>to a water body, coastal water or treatment facility.|

**A1-16** **(12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


h) Carriageway widths may be varied from those given in Chapter 4 of the Nelson
Tasman Land Development Manual 2019, to allow the creation of open space or
planted areas within legal road, provided it can be demonstrated that traffic
movements will not be adversely affected. Compensatory parking bays may need to
be provided in suitable areas.
i) The need for earthworks and recontouring is recognised. However, this should
result in landforms which are visually sympathetic with the existing landforms.
Areas disturbed by earthworks should be restored to an appropriate shape, married
to the existing topography, and revegetated to soften their appearance.
j) Reserves and walkways should be sited with particular regard to providing public
views from the development, especially toward the surrounding hills and towards
the sea. Reserves and walkways should be linked with the road pattern to provide
an integrated open space framework in the development. In planning subdivisions,
sensitive landscapes and landforms should be incorporated within reserves.
k) Utilities and associated structures should be considered in planning the subdivision.
They should be sited, designed and installed in such a way that they do not detract
from the visual quality of the development or of distant views to the development.

### **AP7.4  performance guidelines - rural zone**


**AP7.4.1** **subdivision planning and development**


**AP7.4.1.i** Subdivision planning and development within the Landscape Overlay in the
Rural Zone should meet the following performance guidelines:


a) The subdivision should be planned and designed to reflect, and be in harmony with,
the forms, lines, textures, patterns and colours that exist on the site and in the
landscape context. Forms and lines come mainly from the landforms and their
edges. Textures, patterns and colour are derived mainly from the vegetation cover
and land use.
b) Subdivision should be planned and development carried out so that unnecessary
changes to landform or landscape features are avoided.
c) In planning the subdivision, sensitive landscapes and landforms should be placed in

reserves.
d) The number, shape, size, design and location of lots and building sites are to be
appropriate to the setting.
e) Significant natural and heritage features are to be recognised and protected or
enhanced.
g) Existing vegetation cover of value, both herbaceous and woody, should be retained
and protected.
h) The overall shape of the subdivision and allotment boundaries within it should
coincide with existing natural edges in the landscape, such as ridges, valleys and
streams.
i) Allotment shapes should be related to landform shapes, avoiding arbitrary edges
across landforms.
j) Allotments should be large enough to permit groupings of structures with large
areas of open unbuilt land of rural character between groups of structures.
k) Building sites are to be designated on the subdivision plan, and are to be sized,
shaped and located so that structures can be built with the apex of their rooflines
below the crests of ridges, in order to avoid being silhouetted against the sky.
l) Building sites should be located so that structures on them do not block views from
roads and public reserves.
m) Building sites are to be located so that road access can be provided to them, in an
alignment which is appropriate for the landscape and generally parallel with the
contours, with minimum earthworks and retaining structures and without steep
zigzags.
Roading is to be designed with a curving alignment that reflects the dominant lines
in the landscape context, and which generally parallels the existing contours. Steep
zigzags across the faces of slopes are to be avoided.
Roading should be planned and designed so that there are minimum cuts and fills
and no large retaining structures.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **A7-3**


n) Reserves and walkways should be linked with the road pattern to provide an
integrated open space network through the subdivision.
o) Utilities should be sited, designed and installed in such a way that they do not
detract from the visual quality of the rural landscape, and should, wherever
possible, be placed underground.
p) Where utilities are placed above ground, their alignment should follow existing
contours and they should not be placed in situations where they will be silhouetted
against the sky.
q) Planning, design and development is to ensure that topography is restored to a
contour appropriate to the setting and which marries with adjacent slopes.
r) Appropriate herbaceous and/or woody vegetation cover is to be re-established on
all cuts, fills, backfilled trenches and other disturbed areas as part of the
subdivision planning and development.
s) Blocks of planting should be shaped to reflect existing forms on the site, avoiding
the imposition of arbitrary geometric shapes on slopes. Planting should be carried
out so that silhouetting of single specimens on the skyline is avoided.


**AP7.4.2** **structures in the rural zone**


**AP7.4.2.i** These guidelines are for residential and farm structures within the
Landscape Overlay in the Rural Zone.


Residential structures are considered to include: dwellings and associated outbuildings
such as garages and sheds, and small signs.


**AP7.4.2.ii** Farm structures are considered to include: barns, sheds, silos, yards, tanks,
tracks and small signs.


**AP7.4.2.iii** Structures are made visible in the landscape by their location and their form
and colour. Tracks are made visible by their location, and the line which results from
colour contrast with the background. Farm structures are often more noticeable in the
landscape because of their reflective surfaces and simple forms.


**AP7.4.2.iv** As controlled activities, the Council may exercise control over their
location, design and appearance.


**AP7.4.2.v** The purpose of these guidelines is to describe the management of the
characteristics of residential and farm structures that should be applied in order to
mitigate adverse visual effects in the Landscape Overlay.
a) Larger residential and farm structures should, as much as possible, be located on
the edges of landforms and vegetation patterns.
b) All residential and farm structures should be sited so that the apex of the roofline
does not project above the crest of the ridge and they should have a backdrop of
landform or vegetation.
c) In both residential and farm settings, associated structures should be clustered
together, and reflect unity of design in form and colour.
d) The forms of the structures should reflect background landforms, with moderatelysteep gabled and hip roofs, and variation in the line and form of wall surfaces.
Large unrelieved expanses of roofs and walls, and flat roofs should be avoided.
e) Colours of roofs and walls should be based on the background colours in the
landscape and be low in reflectivity, avoiding garish, unnatural colours. There can
be small areas of accent colour which contrast with the background, such as on
doors or window frames.
f) Signs should be for identification purposes only. They should be few in number and
small in size. They should be as low as possible and located so that they have a
backdrop of landform or vegetation immediately behind. The message area of the
sign should be in a colour derived from the landscape background.
g) Structures, such as yards, retaining walls and bridges should be of natural materials,
such as timber, in forms and lines appropriate for the landscape, and left to
weather naturally or finished with low reflectivity colours.
h) Tracks and access roads should, as much as possible, be located on the edges of
landform and vegetation patterns. They should have a curving alignment and
should run generally parallel with contours and on flatter areas. There should be
minimum cuts and fills. Avoid steep zigzag alignments.

**A10-2** **(12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


### **AP10.3 calculation of coach loading and queuing spaces**

**AP10.3.i** Coach loading and queuing spaces must be provided as set out in
10.3.1, within the net area of every site at which the activity listed in 10.3.1 takes
place.


**AP10.3.ii** Whenever a building is increased in floor area, or undergoes a partial or
total change in activity, queuing requirements for the existing part of the building (if
any) or that part remaining in the existing activity, shall remain unaltered. In this case
the requirements relevant when the original activity, or part of it, shall continue to
apply. Queuing requirements for the increased floor area or that area with a new or
altered activity shall be calculated in accordance with Table 10.3.1.


**AP10.3.iii** Where the activity on the site involves more than one category of use
listed in 10.3.1, the number of on-site spaces required on that site will be the sum of
the requirements for each category.


When the assessment of the total number of queuing spaces results in a part space
being involved, any fraction under one half will be disregarded. Fractions of one half
or more will be counted as one parking space.

a) For the purpose of Table 10.6.1, where the principal activity does not take place
within a building the term ‘gross floor area’ includes the ground area directly
involved in that activity;
b) Where an activity involves more than one of the above categories, the loading
requirement must be determined on the principal activity of the site. Where the
principal activity cannot be determined the higher loading requirement will apply;
c) When the assessment of the number of loading spaces results in a part space being
involved, any fraction under one half will be disregarded. Fractions of one half or
more will be counted as one parking space.


Notwithstanding the above:


i)  where articulated trucks are used in connection with any site, sufficient space not

less than 20m in length and not less than 4.4m high shall be provided.


ii)  each loading space required by the Plan shall have unobstructed vehicular access

to a road or service lane.

activities: Drive-Through Activities, Service Stations and Vehicle Parking Facilities with
20 or more parking spaces.


**AP10.14.1.ii** The number of queuing spaces provided must be in accordance with
Table 10.3.1 provided the number of queuing spaces may be reduced to 1 space, for
service stations or drive-through facilities, if


a) There is an adjacent vehicle moving lane which:
i) is served by an adjacent vehicle control point, and
ii) allows vehicles to move in the same direction as in the main queuing lane, and
iii) has a minimum width of 2.6m, and
iv) complies with manoeuvring, access, formation and marking standards for a

queuing lane.


**AP10.14.2** **queuing space and queuing lane on-site layout**


**AP10.14.2.i** Every queuing space must be of a useable shape and condition, be

AP12.1 – clearances additional to tracking curves) or any larger tracking curve
which may be required under clause h) below, and


e) The traffic direction in the queuing lane is to be one way only provided this shall
not apply to fuel dispensers in service stations. However, no reverse manoeuvre on
or off any road is permitted, and


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **A10-11**


f) Traffic conflicts which may impede traffic flow to or from the vehicle control
point along the queuing lane are not permitted i.e. many access lanes to one
vehicle control point is not permitted (e.g. a merging lane) but one access
branching to many vehicle control points will be permitted (eg: multi island fuel
dispensers), and


g) With the exception of queuing lanes associated with fuel dispensers in service
stations, the queuing lane is to be permanently marked on the pavement surface
together with such traffic control direction as will contribute to its safe use, and


h) Where the drive-through activity or vehicle parking facility is intended
predominantly for vehicles larger than cars then the queuing space, manoeuvring
area, formation and marking must be adequate to suit the predominant vehicle to
be used. In such cases the minimum standard is the 85 percentile 2 axle truck
shown in Appendix 12 (tracking curves).

### **AP10.15 assessment criteria for resource consents**


**AP10.15.1** **general**


**AP10.15.1.i** In considering resource consents for land use activities, in addition to
the applicable provisions of the Act, the Council shall apply the relevant Assessment
Criteria set out below.


**AP10.15.2** **assessment criteria**


**AP10.15.2.i** In considering whether or not to grant consent or impose conditions,
the Council shall have regard to but not be limited by the following specific assessment
criteria.


**a)** **Parking, queuing and loading provision**


i) Whether it is physically practicable to provide the required manoeuvring,
queuing or loading spaces on the site in terms of the existing location of
buildings, access to the road, topography and utility location
ii) Whether there is an adequate alternative supply of loading spaces in the
vicinity which:
a) is sited within easy walking distance of the development;
b) does not require people to cross heavily trafficked roads to access the
development thus jeopardising pedestrian safety and road function;
c) is clearly associated with the development through signs or other means;
d) has a legal agreement bonding the loading to the development;
e) is surrounded by appropriate land use activities with which the loading is
compatible.
**Note:** Other than in the Residential Zone on lightly trafficked streets with
adequate on street parking, in general, on-street queuing and/or loading
spaces is not considered an alternative.
iii) Whether there is another site in the immediate vicinity that has available

loading spaces which are not required at the same time as the proposed
activity. In such a situation the Council will require the associated loading
spaces to be secured in some manner.
iv) Whether a demonstrably less than normal incidence of queuing or loading will

be generated by the proposal, such as due to specific business practice, type
of customer, the particular characteristics of the intended residential
occupants, vehicles servicing the site or vehicles servicing the occupants of
the site, bus transportation


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **A10-13**


v) Whether a significant adverse effect on the character and amenity of the
surrounding area will occur as a result of not providing the required amount
of manoeuvring, queuing or loading space.
vi) The extent to which the safety of pedestrians, particularly children, will be

affected by the reduction or non provision of queuing or loading spaces or by
being set down on-street.
vii) The extent to which the safety and efficiency of the surrounding roading

network would be adversely affected by queued and manoeuvring vehicles on
the roads.
viii) Any cumulative effect of the lack of on-site queuing and loading spaces in

conjunction with other activities in the vicinity not providing the required
number of queuing or loading spaces or by reducing the required manoeuvring

space
ix) The extent to which activities proposed will generate more or less queuing

and/or loading demand than is required by this Plan and the adequacy of the
proposed facilities to meet the demand.
x) Whether loading can be provided and maintained in a jointly used area where
the number of loading spaces provided is equivalent to the sum of
requirements for each activity.
xi) Where the development is located in a Residential Zone or an Open Space and

Recreation Zone, the effect the provision of queuing and/or loading has on
the purposes of these zones and on their environmental results anticipated.
xii) The extent to which the reduction in the amount of queuing and/or loading

spaces will affect the ability of future activities on-site to meet the queuing
and/or loading spaces requirements.
xiii) The extent to which the reduction in the amount of queuing and/or loading

spaces will affect the ability of people with disabilities to gain convenient
access to the activity or development.


**b)** **Parking, queuing and loading area and entranceway design**


i) Any adverse effects on the safety and security of people and vehicles using
the facility.
ii) The extent to which the safety of pedestrians, both on and off the site will be
affected.
iii) Any adverse effects on the amenity and character of surrounding properties

and public areas.
iv) The extent to which there could be any adverse effect on the safety and

efficiency of the frontage road.
v) The extent to which any reduction in the design characteristics could result in
the parking, queuing and loading area and/or access and manoeuvring areas
being impractical, inconvenient or unsafe to be used by vehicles or
pedestrians.
vi) Any cumulative effect of the reduction in the design characteristics in

conjunction with the effects generated by other activities on the frontage
road.


**A10-14** **(12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


**c)** **Particular Assessment Criteria relating to Short Term Living Accommodation**


In considering a controlled or restricted discretionary activity and whether or not
to impose conditions, the Council shall, in addition to the above, have regard to
but not be limited by the following specific assessment criteria.
i) The type of person catered for at the accommodation and the type of
transport they use and the frequency of use.
ii) The type, size and frequency of vehicles (including buses, taxis, service and
staff vehicles) used to service the accommodation.
iii) The extent to which safe loading and unloading of coach passengers is capable

of being provided whether coach parking is provided on or off site.
iv) The extent to which there is adequate and safe parking for coaches without

adversely affecting traffic and pedestrian function and/or safety (including
adequate sight distance to or from the site) of the surrounding road network.
v) The extent to which the traffic and pedestrian function and/or safety of the
surrounding road network will be adversely affected by extra parked and
manoeuvring vehicles and coaches.


**d)** **Parking and loading spaces - location, method and appearance**


Conditions may be imposed to ensure that the parking and loading spaces are:

i) Sited within easy walking distance of the development;
ii) Suitable for the character, intensity and scale of development;
iii) Clearly associated with the development through signage or other means.
iv) Bonded to the development by a legal agreement.
v) Surrounded by appropriate land use activities with which the parking or
loading is compatible.
vi) Landscaped to an appropriate standard.
vii) Bonded to the user by a covenant or some other legal protection where

parking or loading spaces are to be off-site to ensure continued availability.
viii) Less likely to detrimentally affect the safety of the roading network or

pedestrian safety;
ix) Available at times when the parking or loading demand for the activity


occurs.


**e)** **Queuing spaces and queuing lanes - location, method and appearance**


Conditions may be imposed to ensure that any queuing spaces and queuing lanes


are:
i) Suitable for the character, intensity and scale of development;
ii) Less likely to detrimentally affect the safety of the roading network or
pedestrian safety;
iii) Bonded to the user or development by a covenant or some other legal

protection where parking or loading spaces are to be off-site to ensure
continued availability;
iv) Available at times when the demand for the activity occurs.

### **AP10.16 reasons for rules**


**AP10.16.1** **parking and loading space requirements**


**AP10.16.1.i** The provision of off-street loading for each activity minimises the
adverse effects on the safety and efficiency of the road from on-street loading and
manoeuvring vehicles.


**AP10.16.2** **parking and loading area design**


**AP10.16.2.i** The design of the parking and loading areas are based on 85-percentile
design vehicles. The dimension of these vehicles and their associated turning circle
requirements are such that the majority of vehicles in New Zealand comply with their
requirements. Critical manoeuvre areas have been calculated to allow 99% of vehicles
to use them. These areas are bounded by immovable objects such as walls and columns
and it is therefore important to provide the space to allow vehicles to manoeuvre
easily.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **A10-15**


**AP10.16.2.ii** Controls over the surfacing of parking and loading areas have been
included to protect the amenity of surrounding properties and public places from noise
and dust nuisance. The controls are also intended to avoid deterioration of road and
footpath surfaces or vehicle and pedestrian safety through loose surfacing material
being carried onto footpaths, roads or service lanes.


**AP10.16.2.iii** Controls on the gradient of parking areas have been included so that it
is safe and easy for people to get into and out of their vehicles.


**AP10.16.3** **reverse manoeuvring**


**AP10.16.3.i** On site manoeuvring is required for all sites on Classified Roads, shared
accesses, and where a large number of vehicle movements onto and off a site are
expected. This helps to protect the efficiency and safety of roads that are desirable
through routes by minimising the number of vehicles required to reverse onto or off a
site. It is not permitted to reverse manoeuvre onto Classified Roads as their main
function is as a through route accommodating a variety of mode and trip lengths with
access to adjacent land having less importance than Unclassified Roads.


**AP10.16.4** **queuing spaces**


**AP10.16.4.i** Queuing spaces and queuing lanes are required at the entrance to
vehicle based service areas for Drive–Through Activities, Service Stations and Vehicle
Parking Facilities to provide an area off the street for vehicles to queue while waiting
for goods or services, or for a parking space. This protects the safety and efficiency of
the frontage road from the effects of vehicles requiring to queue on the street,
blocking traffic lanes, or causing pedestrians to leave the footpath in order to move
across queued traffic.

provision for the safe movement of pedestrians about the site, at the vehicle
crossings associated with the site and for their safe movement across roads in the
vicinity of the site without an adverse effect on the operation of the frontage
road.

### **AP11.5 gates**


**AP11.5.1** Gates, garage doors and other like openings must be hung so that they
swing into the site and not over any road or adjoining site. Tilting garage doors and
similar openings must not, at any time, overhang any road or adjoining site.


**AP11.5.2** Building doors or windows when opened must not overhang any
required vehicle access.

### **AP11.6 assessment criteria for resource consents**


**AP11.6.1** **access**


a) Whether adequate sight lines are available from alternative access points.
b) The extent to which the safety and efficiency of the adjoining road would be
compromised by an access point located closer to an intersection or with lesser
unobstructed sight distances, than is permitted by the Plan.
c) The extent to which conflicts between vehicles would be created by vehicles
queuing across the vehicle crossing. Confusion between vehicles could be created
by vehicles queuing across the vehicle crossing, or between vehicles turning at the
crossing or the intersection, or by an inadequate rate of driver assimilation of
data, thereby adversely affecting the safety of the road.
d) Whether the hours of operation of activities on the site coincide with the peak
flows and vehicle queues on the road.
e) Whether the speed and volume of vehicles on the road could increase the adverse
effects of the access on the safety of road users. Whether the geometry of the
road could mitigate the adverse effects of the access.
f) The ability to provide access to allotments without the need for extensive
retaining walls, and in particular, without the need for any retaining walls located
on legal road.
g) The ability of the proposed vehicle crossing(s) to minimise conflict points with
people walking and cycling on shared paths/footpaths and to maximise the berm
and on street parking area so as to contribute to a high amenity road environment.
h) The extent of compliance with the Nelson Residential Street Frontage Guideline.


**AP11.6.2** **vehicle orientated commercial activities**


a) The design and layout of accesses, manoeuvring aisles, car parking and loading
areas and the potential effect of these on the safety and efficiency of the frontage
road.
b) Provision for the safe movement of pedestrians about the site and on the adjacent
frontage road.
c) The safety and efficiency of the access taking into account the regulating speed
limit on the frontage road, available visibility, road geometry, and vehicle volumes
on the frontage road.
d) The relative proximity of other accesses or road intersections and the potential for
cumulative adverse effects on the safety and efficiency of the frontage road.
e) Any proposed design or works, on-road or on-site to mitigate any potential adverse
effect of the access on the safe and efficient functioning of the frontage road.
f) The degree to which the location of the site in combination with the position of
any proposed and existing access points will affect the safe and efficient


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **A11-3**


movement of traffic onto and off the site and along the adjoining roadway taking
into account the following matters:
i) the types of manoeuvres anticipated to be undertaken at the intersection
ii) the forms of control at adjacent intersections
iii) the functions of the frontage road and any intersecting roads
iv) the speed and volumes of through traffic
v) the physical features of the roadway, i.e. number of lanes, visibility
vi) whether the driveway will be on an upstream or downstream side of the

intersection.
g) The ability for vehicles to queue and be serviced on-site without affecting the safe
movement of vehicles or pedestrians along the adjoining road or footpath or the
movement of vehicles and pedestrians using the facilities on the site. The design
and appearance of any building, its visual impact from the road, and its proximity
to residential areas. The degree to which any heavy commercial vehicles and other
service vehicles may enter and exit the site without excessive manoeuvring or
disruption to vehicles being serviced on the site or serving the activity or the safe
movement of vehicles along the adjoining road.

### **AP11.7 reasons for rules**


**AP11.7.1** **distances of vehicle crossings from intersections**


**AP11.7.1.i** In order to simplify the driving task by reducing potential conflict points
and areas of distraction, there is a requirement to locate entrances at varying
distances from intersections depending on the function of the road. Arterial roads
typically carry the highest traffic volumes at higher operating speeds. Distances
therefore need to be greater on these roads to allow for driver reaction times and also
for longer queuing distances at intersections. It also reduces confusion for drivers who
may not otherwise be able to tell whether an indicating vehicle is intending to turn at
the driveway or the intersection. Similarly, principal and collector roads carry higher
traffic volumes at higher operating speeds than local roads and distances of vehicle
crossings from intersections are accordingly required to be greater on these roads.


**AP11.7.2** **maximum number, spacing and width of vehicle crossings**


**AP11.7.2.i** In order to simplify the driving task the number, spacing and width of
vehicle crossings has been regulated. Arterial roads generally operate at higher speeds
and volumes and drivers have an expectation that there will be less activity from
adjoining land. Controls on the number of access per property aims to reduce conflict
points between vehicles and pedestrians and cyclists on shared paths and footpaths.
The controls also maximise the amount of berm for landscaping and maximise the area
available for on street parking thereby improving the amenity of the road environment.
The control on the width of crossings provides adequate width for the vehicles likely to
be using them while defining the point where vehicles are likely to enter and exit the
site.


**AP11.7.3** **design of vehicle access**


**AP11.7.3.i** The controls on the design of accesses onto State Highways and arterial
roads recognise that the safety and efficiency of these routes should be maintained.
The controls on the angle of the road access positions the driver such that they are
able to see approaching vehicles in either direction. In addition, drivers have to slow
to enter the access which provides an obvious signal to following drivers and improves
on-site safety.


**AP11.7.3.ii** The seal widening provided for on State Highways and arterial roads
where the speed limit is over 50 km/hr provides an additional sealed area. This ranges
from a design where drivers can slow down out of the traffic, or move around vehicles
making a turn with less effect on through traffic, to a design which provides for the
manoeuvring of trucks such as milk tankers. In the latter case it provides for a vehicle


**A11-4                                    (12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


to make its manoeuvre on a sealed surface without the need to cross into the opposing
traffic lane when making a left turn into an access.


**AP11.7.3.iii** The minimum visibility distances are required to maintain the safety of
the roading network. The distances are related to the 85th percentile speed of
approaching vehicles as stopping distances are related to traffic speed. The distances
are less for residential uses which have lower traffic numbers and more regular users
than other activities. The maximum gradient and restrictions on breakover angles is to
provide for ease of access.


**AP11.7.3.iv** Design plans for access to individual lots are required at subdivision
consent and engineering design approval stages to ensure that Council and future
owners can be satisfied that practical access is able to be constructed.


**AP11.7.4** **vehicle orientated commercial activities**


**AP11.7.4.i** It is necessary that vehicles entering and exiting these activities can do
so without adversely affecting the safety and efficiency of traffic along the adjoining
roadway. Crossings must therefore have sufficient width to allow the safe movement of
vehicles but at the same time not be so wide that vehicles are poorly channelled into
the site. The vehicle manoeuvring areas should be designed such that there is sufficient
space for the queuing of all vehicles wishing to access the activity for whatever reason.

**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **A12-1**


# **appendix 14** **residential** **subdivision** **design &** **information** **requirements**

### **AP14 introduction**

**AP14.i** Appendix 14 sets out the information requirements that must
accompany restricted discretionary subdivision activities under Rule REr.107. It also
lists a number of indicators that can be used to assess how a design responds to the
district wide Urban Design Objectives and Polices contained in Chapter 5 DO13A and
the appropriate Zone Objectives and Policies in the NRMP.


**AP14.ii** It is intended that Appendix 14 will apply, and can be adapted to, a
range of development types and scenarios including small scale infill, comprehensive
housing and large scale greenfield subdivision.

### **AP14.1 eneral** **g**


**AP14.1.i** Appendix 14 and the restricted discretionary activity subdivision
provisions under Rule REr.107 are provided because the Council recognises that in
pursuing better urban design it is difficult to achieve such a goal by imposing
prescriptive rules and minimum standards. This will be particularly relevant for hillside
greenfield subdivision and intensification within the existing residential area.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/11/12)** **A14-1**


In recognition of this barrier, the restricted discretionary category provides an avenue
for those designs that may not comply in full with the mandatory standards set out in
the Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019. Such developments may in fact
still represent quality urban design for the particular site and therefore warrant a
restricted discretionary activity status and non-notified consent process.


**AP14.1.ii** In order for the Council to provide the level of certainty associated and
expected of a restricted discretionary activity, high quality information must be
provided with applications. Applications need to illustrate clearly why particular
design approaches are proposed, and how the whole design contributes towards the
goal of better urban design within the context of the sites local environment.


**AP14.1.iii** Chapter 5 DO13A Objectives and Policies set the framework for the
type of subdivision and development that is sought and the type of design process to be
pursued. Appendix 14 does not describe in detail what quality urban design is
considered to be for Nelson. Quality design outcomes rely on the subdivision designer
and/or design team possessing a good knowledge of urban design approaches and
techniques. In other words, this section does not tell applicants what to do, but rather
what to show to demonstrate how the design meets the desired outcomes sought for
residential neighbourhoods and the community as a whole. This process recognises
that there may be many different solutions that are acceptable beyond what can be
simply prescribed for with minimum standards.


**AP14.1.iv** It is expected that the Appendix 14 requirements will result in better
quality urban design outcomes, better informed decision making, and more certainty
for everyone. They should:


a) make applicants think carefully about the quality of the resource consent
application (this should improve the general quality of applications).
b) give applicants the opportunity to explain and justify their proposal to Council
officers, decision makers and the people they consult with.
c) ensure that the urban design objectives and policies in the Plan are considered at
the outset of the design process to guide the development of site responsive
solutions.
d) help with pre-application consultation and the understanding and negotiation of
changes to designs, as they can set out ideas for discussion.
e) provide consistent application standards for restricted discretionary subdivision
activities that will enable consistent and efficient consent processing.
f) control the way subdivision and development is constructed, and the way public
spaces are used and managed.

a) contours including identification of prominent ridgelines and valleys.
b) soils/geotechnical constraints/contamination, fault hazard lines.
c) rivers, streams, ephemeral water courses, overland flow paths and stormwater
catchments.
d) existing vegetation and biodiversity corridors.
e) identification of:

i) landscape assets to preserve (significant features).
ii) landscape features to re use or enhance (less significant features which
can be used to achieve multiple goals as part of a subdivision such as
restoration of ephemeral gullies and wetlands which can incorporate low
impact stormwater approaches and adjoining walkway/cycleway
networks).
f) existing services: wastewater, water, and stormwater networks including capacity

information, and transmission lines.
g) any overlays as shown in the NRMP Planning Maps (Landscape, Hazard, Land

Management, Riparian, Heritage Trees etc). These are available digitally from
Council.
h) existing buildings and structures.
i) natural, cultural or archaeological features identified from consultation with NZ

Historic Places Trust, Archaeological File Keeper at Department of Conservation or
local iwi.
j) summary of opportunities and constraints – areas identified as suitable for

development, areas requiring preservation and enhancement, and areas suitable
for incorporation in movement networks, low impact stormwater servicing, and
open space networks. Depending upon the scale of the development, the
summary of opportunities and constraints may need to be provided on a separate
overlay.

**AP14.2.1.vi** Based on the above information, a summary of the opportunities and
constraints present should be prepared. This should identify areas suitable for
development, areas requiring preservation and enhancement, and areas suitable for
incorporation in movement networks, low impact stormwater servicing, and open space
networks. Depending upon the scale of the development, the summary of
opportunities and constraints may need to be provided on a separate overlay.

sections may be necessary to illustrate site specific design responses.
iii) large scale and greenfield subdivision must show public transport
connections and future route extensions, including provision for bus stops.
Applicants should consult with Council’s Transport Officers to ascertain
requirements.
iv) a ‘ped-shed’ walkability analysis may also be necessary for large scale
subdivisions with mixed densities and zoning.

**AP14.3.1** **movement network**


**AP14.3.i** Chapter 4 of the Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019
provides advice on the road standards relative to function and speed environments, use
of and standards for cul de sacs, residential lanes and rights of way. Council’s
Transport Officers can provide advice regarding existing traffic movements, intended
connections and any upgrading plans or requirements.


**AP14.3.ii** **Quality subdivision will:**
1. Connect to its wider context both physically and visually.

a. Provide connections and convenient access to services and facilities in the
surrounding neighbourhood.
b. Connect to existing roading networks at several points to provide
convenient access and choice of routes.
c. Anticipate and provide for connections to existing and possible future
development on adjoining sites.
2. Provide an interconnected network of streets that provides convenient access for all

road users including pedestrians and cyclists.

a. Provide multiple choice of routes to any destination.
b. Where the topography requires long cul-de-sacs and precludes street
interconnection, provide for regular interconnection with safe, attractive
walkways.
3. Create a street structure which is clear and legible.
4. Minimise earthworks on steep sites with roads that follow original land contours


**AP14.3.2** **open space network**


**AP14.3.2.i** The Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019 contains a chapter
on parks and reserves which details the different types of Council owned reserves and
their design requirements. Council staff can provide advice in respect of the need or
not of particular reserves in particular locations, and should be consulted prior to
proposing the selection of any site for an intended public reserve. Where significant
landscapes and ecological and natural features exist on site they should be assessed for
their suitability for incorporation into the subdivision design. Subdivision design has
the potential to incrementally enhance biodiversity corridors in Nelson and is an
important component of quality urban design and the suitability of wildlife.


**AP14.3.2.ii** **Quality subdivision will:**
1. Identify and maintain any recognised view connections across the site.
2. Celebrate views from streets and other public spaces to landmarks and other

important features that are beyond the site boundaries.
3. Extend broader neighbourhood patterns of open space with landscape features that

strengthen the identity and structure of the landscape such as street trees,
landscape links with adjoining neighbourhoods, and open space and reserve
networks.

a. Enhance and incrementally extend existing biodiversity corridors.
b. Retain native vegetation, mature trees and significant ecological features
and use these as features within public open space.
4. Locate local parks where they:

a. Are of most benefit to the local community.
b. Will be overlooked from the street and dwelling frontages to ensure
informal surveillance.
c. Are not more than 400 metres walking distance from most dwellings.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **A14-9**


**AP14.3.3** **landscape**


**AP14.3.3.i** **Quality subdivision will:**
1. Maintain important landscape patterns

a. Preserve significant landscape and landform features.
b. Restore and extend riparian restoration treatments and biodiversity
corridors
2. Use landscape features to enhance the amenity, character and recreational

potential of the development.
3. Retain areas of native vegetation, mature trees or significant ecological features,

and locate these in public areas where possible.
4. Provide both visual and physical access to the main landscape elements and

features.


**AP14.3.4** **streetscape and open space design**


**AP14.3.4.i** Streetscape applies to more than just the legal road, it stretches from
one building on one side of the road to the front of the building on the opposite side.


**AP14.3.4.ii** **Quality subdivision will:**
1. Consider the visual amenity, safety and comfort of the users of public space.

a. Include safe and comfortable facilities for pedestrians and access for
cyclists.
b. Ensure there are good sightlines along any connecting lanes or walkways.
c. Include street landscaping that creates a high level of visual amenity while
maintaining openness at eye level.
2. Achieve visual coherence in design, with individual spaces and elements relating to

a wider neighbourhood framework and patterns and, where appropriate, developing
local identity.
3. Integrate local parks that provide a flat, grassed area open area suitable for

informal kick-about and trees.
4. Include streets that gain identity and amenity from intensive street tree planting.
5. Integrate multiple functions including recreation, access, biodiversity and

stormwater control into streets and other open spaces.


**AP14.3.5** **stormwater management**


**AP14.3.5.i** Stormwater management and low impact design should be considered
early in the site planning process as these will usually influence the design of the
subdivision and roads. The Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019 provides
design objectives and standards for reticulated and low impact stormwater
management in the stormwater section, and the parks and reserves section provides
guidance on when a stormwater device is acceptable within a public reserve, and the
level of reserves contribution offset provided. Given Nelson’s hilly topography and soils
it will be difficult for a design to rely solely on low impact approaches and these will
likely need to be combined with a reticulated system.


**AP14.3.5.ii** **Quality subdivision will:**
1. Maintain streams and watercourses and enhance their natural character by

minimising any changes to the hydrological factors by affecting flows.
2. Utilise low-impact stormwater management devices wherever possible for flood

mitigation, maintenance of base flows in natural watercourses, irrigation and to
create visual amenity.


**A14-10** **(12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


3. Provide stormwater capacity to allow for upstream flows from land with

development potential as well as the ability for the downstream network to
accommodate off site flows.
4. Locate low impact stormwater management devices within public roads and


reserves.


**AP14.3.6** **allotment layout**


**AP14.3.6.i** Lots are encouraged to be laid out in such a manner that future
dwellings will be orientated to the adjoining public space, be it road or reserve.


**AP14.3.6.ii** **Quality subdivision will:**
1. Provide for local facilities and services at, or accessible from, the centre of the

development.
2. Provide a range of lot sizes and types which will allow for diversity of living options.
3. Cluster smaller lots to:

a. maximise proximity to facilities.
b. avoid subdivision over outstanding natural features and to provide high quality
public open spaces and reserves.
4. Ensure lots are shaped and dimensioned to allow a sunny outdoor living space and

provide a useable private back yard.
5. Locate lots so that they overlook and front road and open spaces and back onto

other lots.
6. Intensify development on sunny, north sloping lots, and reduce intensity on south

facing lots.
7. Complement and not compromise both existing and likely future uses on adjacent

sites.


**AP14.3.7** **reticulated services**


**AP14.3.7.i** The Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019 provides minimum
standards and information requirements necessary to accompany an application,
including requirements for street lighting.


**AP14.3.7.ii** **Quality subdivision will:**
1. Take an integrated multi-disciplinary approach to the provision and siting of services

to achieve servicing efficiency at the same time as maximising amenity benefits.
2. Locate underground services where they are properly accessible for servicing and

also allow for street tree planting.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **A14-11**


**AP22.5.ii** The development should be designed to maintain a reasonable standard
of amenity for the residents of neighbouring properties, having regard to, but not being
limited to the following:
a) visual privacy of the main internal and associated external living areas of
neighbouring dwellings.
b) access of sunlight and daylight to neighbouring sites (using Rule REr.35 ‘Daylight
Admission’ and the provisions of Appendix 15 – daylight admission (residential)).
c) maintenance of reasonable levels of outlook for neighbours outside of the subject
site.
d) minimisation of the opportunities for crime by application of Crime Prevention
Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles, including passive surveillance of
streets and other public places.
e) acoustic privacy .

### **AP22.6 access, parking and services**


**AP22.6.i** Comprehensive Housing Developments should provide for safe
movement of pedestrians and vehicles.

e.g. well lit parking areas and pedestrian links; defined footpaths in larger

developments.
e.g. minimising number of vehicle accesses to roads, traffic calming in larger

developments, dust control.


**AP22.6.ii** Careful consideration should be given to:
a) access for emergency services, including to outdoor space.
b) positioning of services to allow for their repair and maintenance.


**AP22.6.iii** Parking, access and services should be in accordance with Appendices
10 (standards and terms for parking and loading) and 11 (access standards), and the
mandatory matters in Chapter 4 of the Nelson Tasman Land Development Manual 2019.

### **AP22.7 consent applications**


**AP22.7.1** **consultation**


**AP22.7.1.i** Early consultation with Council’s Major Projects Team and/or Urban
Design Panel is strongly encouraged to help resolve design and other issues prior to
lodging consent applications.


**AP22.7.2** **supporting information required**


The following information and assessment is required to be provided as part of an
application for Comprehensive Housing under Rule REr.22. The amount of detail
required is relative to the nature and scale of the development.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **A22-5**


**AP22.7.2.i** **Sketch Plans**


Applications for any Comprehensive Housing Development shall include “sketch plans or
photo montages or visual simulations” to an appropriate scale which show the total
design, not necessarily with construction details. The plans/photos/simulations must
include:
a) elevations. The street elevation(s) of the buildings shall be extended to show the
buildings on either side (as a less favoured alternative, photographs of adjoining
buildings may substitute for the adjoining elevations, if a clear scale is indicated).
b) floor plans (which must show and name rooms and areas of storage, and show
location of windows and doors, and the outline of eaves or overhanging areas in
relation to foundation plans).
c) site plans showing:

i) nominated legal boundaries or any proposed lease or other title
arrangements
ii) the area of outdoor space, and the dimension and placement of living courts
iii) location of roads, parking and services
iv) location of buildings on adjoining properties (including windows facing the

development)
v) a 3-dimensional view of the development showing a “true perspective”
vi) site contours (graduations as appropriate to the scale of the development

and the topography of the site).


d) any information required by Council or the Resource Management Act as part of a
standard application for resource consent.
e) information on how the subdivision is to be effected (freehold allotment, unit
title, company lease). Where a Body Corporate is proposed, a description of how
it will operate.
f) a landscape plan, including location and height of any fences, which demonstrates
how landscaping is used to enhance the on-site and off-site amenity of the
development, and integrating roads, allotments and the streetscape. (The
retention of existing vegetation is encouraged as this can help integrate a
Comprehensive Housing Development into the existing streetscape, and therefore
make it more acceptable. The plan should show existing vegetation, noting any
mature trees or significant specimens, and should indicate which vegetation will
be retained and which will be removed). The landscape plan shall be
implemented before section 224 approval is granted. (Where the development
does not involve a subdivision, the resource consent will include a condition on
satisfactory implementation of the landscape plan).
g) a site context plan which shows the features of the area relevant to considering
the suitability of a particular location for a comprehensive housing development,
or which have had a bearing on the proposed design of the development. The site
context plan should focus on features within a 400m radius of the site but can
include items further away if relevant. A list of features to specifically identify

are:

i) open space (parks, rivers/streams, school playing fields, beach etc),
ii) transport routes (main roads, walkways, cycle ways, bus routes),
iii) shops, commercial areas, schools (including pre-school),
iv) all possible vehicle access points,
v) opportunities for street links to neighbouring sites with development
potential,
vi) orientation of neighbouring buildings or developments (do they face toward

or away from the subject site),
vii) stormwater flow paths.
This list is not exhaustive and there are likely to be other features and facilities in
the area which can also be identified. The Comprehensive Housing Development
site context plan can be shown in conjunction with the requirements of Appendix
14 (Residential Subdivision Design and Information Requirements) as required by a
subdivision consent.


**A22-6** **(12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


# **appendix 23** **design guide** **and rules for** **Wakefield Quay**

### **AP23 overview**

**AP23.i** Wakefield Quay is recognised as an area of special amenity value, and
the Council therefore considers that any changes to the existing environment should
continue these amenities

### **AP23.1 introduction**


**AP23.1.1** **guideline purpose**


**AP23.1.1.i** The purpose of this guide is to define the characteristics of the area,
establish appropriate controls, and require that new projects comply.


**AP23.1.2** **subject area**


**AP23.1.2.i** The area subject to these guidelines and referred to as a “Precinct” is
the area defined on Planning Maps 9 and 10 of the Nelson Resource Management Plan
(the Plan), reproduced here as Figure 1. It is generally described as follows:


_That area comprising those sections fronting Wakefield Quay, commencing at No. 1 on_
_the east side of Poynters Crescent, continuing to No. 395 on the east side of Richardson_
_Street, inclusive of the sea edge and adjacent water._


**AP23.1.2.ii** The area immediately behind and above the subject area is not
considered to be under pressure for change.


**AP23.1.3** **reason for guidelines and rules**


**AP23.1.3.i** Wakefield Quay and the Port Hills have been occupied over time by low
density private houses. This rate and scale of development, together with the climate
and geographical features of the area, have combined to create an enviable environment
and lifestyle for residents and visitors.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (01/09/04)** **A23-1**


**AP23.1.3.ii** The trend of development of Wakefield Quay has changed to include
multi unit residential projects. It is also considered that:


a) the resident and transient population will continue to increase.
b) the desirability of Wakefield Quay is such that the pressure for change to higher
density occupation will continue and increase.
c) the attractiveness of the area near the Marine Rescue Centre will fuel interest in
the subject area, and pedestrian use of the sea edge will increase as a result.
d) the attractiveness of Wakefield Quay is such that any detraction caused by vehicle
traffic density will not dampen the demand for change, or the desire to reside in
and use the area.
e) the higher density residential occupation will increase demand for vehicle access
and off street parking with a resulting impact upon road vehicle and cycle
movements.


**AP23.1.3.iii** In the absence of design guidance and rules it cannot be assumed that
the amenity value of the area will be retained.


**AP23.1.3.iv** These design guidelines together with appropriate rules intend to allow
for developments which will be compatible with this area and reflect its existing
characteristics.

### **AP23.2 aims**


**AP23.2.i** To maintain those established features of the area which contribute to
its amenity value, such as residential building scale, intimacy, architecture, vegetation,
outlook, and pedestrian use, while allowing for future higher density residential
development together with any compatible uses.


**AP23.2.ii** To accommodate uses which will not impact adversely on residential
occupancy of the precinct, while recognising that the occupancy of the subject area is
residential, and to ensure that change does not create significant adverse impact on
privacy and daylight amenity or otherwise compromise existing residential use.


**AP23.2.iii** To maintain and enhance the largely unobstructed and special
relationship with the sea edge and harbour and develop or enhance interaction between
the houses, road, and sea shore.


**AP23.2.iv** To discourage development which will materially reduce amenity value,
dominate the precinct, significantly alter the residential scale and character of the
existing built environment, or depreciate the enjoyment and availability of the sea edge
and harbour environment.


**AP23.2.v** To recognise that continuance and enhancement of those characteristics
that are contributing to the established amenity value of the area, is important not only
to residents’ enjoyment of the precinct, but also to that of all who visit, pass through,
utilise or view it.


**AP23.2.vi** To maintain and enhance the existing pattern of terracing and layering
of structures on elevated sites, surrounded and separated by vegetation.


**AP23.2.vii** To ensure that replacement or additional vegetation is of such extent,
density, scale and richness, that it will maintain and enhance the existing environment,
and ensure that the permanency and extent of vegetation along the upper part of the
cliff is not materially reduced.


**AP23.2.viii** To enhance and maintain all aspects of human participation in, and use
of, the area.


**AP23.2.ix** To maintain and enhance the visual amenity and character of the area as
seen from the Harbour or by pedestrians on Wakefield Quay.


**AP23.2.x** To recognise the significant traffic volume on Wakefield Quay and limited
availability of on street parking, and to ensure that any developments adequately address
any adverse effects of extra traffic generated by the development.


**A23-2                                    (12/07/21) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


_**Explanation and Reasons**_


**AP23.5.4.iv** The purpose of Rule D is to limit the “visual bulk” of any building to a
degree commensurate with the aims of Appendix 22, in the context of the Wakefield
Quay Precinct.


The exclusion of roofed over balconies and decks from the plot ratio calculation is to
encourage the inclusion of a building element which could add to the detailing of the
building. However, the covering can only be another open deck or balcony on an upper
level, or a separate roof. The deck or balcony cannot be covered by an overhang of
the building proper, as that would work against the terracing sought in AP23.4.2, and
the detailing in AP23.5.8.


**AP23.4.5** **rule E - vegetation**


**AP23.4.5.i** The green band of vegetation behind the existing houses from the
building height line up to the eastern boundary of the precinct shall be maintained.


**AP23.4.6** **rule F - parking and access**


**AP23.4.6.i** Parking requirements are as for the Residential Zone [See the Nelson
Resource Management Plan, Appendix 10 (standards terms for parking and loading) and
Appendix 11 (access standards)] except:


a) where there are three or more residential units in a development, the following

matters will be considered as a restricted discretionary activity – the number,
location, and width of vehicle crossings, and the direction of access and egress to
and from the crossing(s). Applications will be considered without notification, or
obtaining the written consent of affected persons, under s94 of the Act); and


**AP23.4.6.ii** On-site turning shall be provided.


**AP22.4.6.iii** Garaging in the front yard shall be discreet, and colour and design shall
match the building. No more than one level of parking is permitted to be visible from
street frontage.


**Note:** On-street parking is limited and access is difficult. Particular attention shall be
paid to safe access and egress from the site. This will include checking sight lines for
drivers. See REr.30 (buildings and fences near vehicle accesses) and Appendix 11 (access
standards).


**AP23.4.7** **rule G - front yard**


**AP23.4.7.i** Building coverage of the area within 4m of the road boundary shall not
exceed 50%.


**AP22.4.7.ii** A minimum of 50% of the front yard area not built on shall be landscaped.
This area shall not include required sight lines for exiting vehicles.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/07/21)** **A23-7**


### **AP23.5 desi n uidelines** **g g**

**AP23.5.1** **activities**


**AP23.5.1.i** Note that in accordance with the Plan any activity which is not a
residential activity (except a home occupation) is a discretionary activity, and requires
a resource consent application.


**AP23.5.1.ii** These guidelines acknowledge the variety of activity in the Precinct.
Activities which complement the existing environment and enhance the residential
quality of the Precinct such as small cafes and guesthouses will add to the general
streetscape if designed appropriately.


**AP23.5.1.iii** Activities unrelated to the Precinct attracting high car counts or which
significantly encourage pedestrians to cross the busy road shall be discouraged e.g. fast
food, general retail shops.


**AP23.5.2** **heritage buildings**


**AP23.5.2.i** The listed Heritage Buildings are important elements in the Precinct. Any
work on Group A and B buildings must comply with the requirements of the Plan (see
Residential Rule Table).


**AP23.5.2.ii** New buildings which are to be located beside “Group A” buildings should
be developed in a scale and context related to the heritage building and should enhance
rather than embarrass it. This does not mean a new building should replicate the heritage
building.


**AP23.5.3** **the sea edge**


**AP23.5.3.i** No new structures will be allowed on the sea edge side of Wakefield Quay
or adjacent water except as covered in AP23.5.3.iii, AP23.5.3.iv and AP23.5.3.vi.


**AP23.5.3.ii** The existing Boat Shed Cafe and Boat House have great heritage value
(Group A buildings) and shall be retained.


**AP23.5.3.iii** Additions to existing buildings shall not be permitted, unless they are
minor (See REr.85 – heritage buildings, places and objects: alterations to Group A and B
items) and do not obstruct the view from the road or from the houses along Wakefield
Quay. They shall be designed to be sympathetic to the existing building.


**AP23.5.3.iv** Replacement of an existing building because of fire or natural disaster
will be allowed, but the new structure shall be within the existing building envelope and
be designed to complement the existing architecture.


**AP23.5.3.v** The existing chain fence and sea wall have significant visual and
historical value and shall be retained.


**AP23.5.3.vi** Development of seating and steps down to the water, landscaping and
general development of “people spaces” is to be encouraged. However, the design shall
be sympathetic to the sea wall and chain fence with matching materials. The general
line of the sea wall must not be interrupted, particularly when viewed from the sea. The
view from the road or from houses along Wakefield Quay shall not be obstructed.


**AP23.5.4** **vegetation and landscape**


**AP23.5.4.i** Vegetation at street level or near the front of the site is important to
link in with the existing planting and to soften walls and garaging. The use of evergreen
trees is encouraged.


**AP23.5.4.ii** Permanent planting on terrace areas is encouraged to break up and
soften walls and garaging.


**A23-8                                    (01/09/04) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


**DN16.5.iii** Mitigation

a) keep construction disturbance where possible to daylight hours
b) flood lighting focus and damping units where practicable, and landscape screening
c) The Nelson City Council (and any subsequent owner or occupier) will, on the strip
of land being part of CT 90/4 and CT 90/5 fronting the Main Road, Stoke to a
depth of 10 meters (“strip of land”) establish and thereafter maintain a buffer
strip of land. For the purposes of the clause “buffer strip” shall mean appropriate
landscape features established for the express purpose of limiting the visibility
from Saxton Field of industrial type activities being undertaken on the land across
the Main Road, Stoke. Such landscape features may comprise earth mounds, tree
and shrub plantings. No buildings will be erected on the strip of land except
where the building drainage of storm water and sewage, electricity,
telecommunications and radio communication provided that such utility building
does not require permanent manning for operational purposes.


**DN16.6** **explanatory statement**


**DN16.6.i** Proposed restrictions - Saxton Park extension

a) living quarters for a custodian will meet the normal performance requirements for
residential sites in this Plan
b) service buildings (excluding stadiums) will not, as far as practicable, exceed 50m [2]
each, in area and exceed 18m in height
c) playground structures will not, as far as practicable, exceed 3m in height


**DN16.6.ii** For (a) to (c) above height will be measured in accordance with this Plan.


**DN16.6.iii** Some utilities cross over the area to be designated. Further installations
and relocations would require the prior written consent of the controlling authority.


**DN16.6.iv** The land to be designated is considered to be vital for strategic
recreation planning for future urban growth in both Nelson City and Tasman District. As
it is an addition to an existing regional park, alternative sites are limited.


**DN16.6.v** Consultation is underway with landowners. Alliance Group Limited have
been consulted.
