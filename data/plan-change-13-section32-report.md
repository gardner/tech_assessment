### **SECTION 32 REPORT - PROPOSED PLAN CHANGE 13** **MARSDEN VALLEY REZONING AND STRUCTURE PLAN** **PROJECT**

**1.0** **INTRODUCTION**

**1.1** **Purpose of Report**

Section 32 of the Resource Management Act (RMA) requires Council to consider
alternatives and assess the benefits and costs of adopting any objective, policy, rule or
method in the District Plan. Before publicly notifying a proposed Plan Change, the
Council is required to prepare a Section 32 report summarising these considerations.

The purpose of this report is to fulfil these Section 32 requirements for Proposed Plan
Change 13 “Marsden Valley Structure Plan”.

**1.2** **Approach followed in undertaking the Section 32 evaluations**

The 7 broad steps which this section 32 evaluation follows are:


1. identifying the resource management issue
2. evaluating the extent to which any objective is the most appropriate way to
achieve the purpose of the RMA
3. identifying alternative policies and methods of achieving the objective
4. assessing the effectiveness of alternative policies and methods
5. assessing the benefits and costs of the proposed and alternative policies, rules,
or other methods
6. examining the risk of acting or not acting if there is uncertain or insufficient
information about the subject matter of the policies, rules, or other methods
7. deciding which method or methods are the most appropriate given their likely
effectiveness and their likely cost, relative to the benefit that would likely
deliver


Further clarification on how this is undertaken in this report is outlined in section
1.2.1-1.2.3 below.


**1.2.1** **Resource Management issue being addressed**

An issue is an existing or potential problem that must be resolved to promote the
purpose of the RMA. The RMA does not require the identification or analysis of
issues within Section 32 evaluations. Notwithstanding this issues are being included
in this report because it will be helpful to users to understand the basis and origin of
the issue as this provides a context for the evaluations of the objectives and policies
that follow.


RAD 805233 3


**1.2.2** **Evaluation of the objective(s) – the environmental outcome to be achieved**

Section 32 requires an evaluation of the extent to which the objective is the most
appropriate to achieve the purpose of the Act. Appropriateness is not defined in the
Act. In undertaking the evaluation it has generally been helpful to consider alternative
forms of the objective and test them in terms of how well they met the environmental,
social/cultural, and economic outcomes in Section 5, plus achieving other Part 2
matters. Often these assessments require value judgements because they are not
readily quantified. Usually the objective is also tested against how well it addresses
the elements of the issue.

**1.2.3** **Evaluation of alternative policies and methods (including rules) – what is**
**Council going to do to achieve the objective**

The evaluation of appropriateness assesses the alternative policy options under the
headings of effectiveness, efficiency, benefits, costs, the risk of acting and the risk of
not acting. A range of criteria/matters have been used to assist in undertaking the
evaluations:

(a) efficiency - the ratio of inputs to outputs. Efficiency is high where a small
effort/cost is likely to produce a proportionately larger return. Includes the
ease of administration/administrative costs e.g. if the cost of processing a grant
or collecting a fee exceeds the value of the grant or fee, that is not very
efficient;
(b) effectiveness - how well it achieves the objective or implements the policy
relative to other alternatives. The likelihood of uptake of a method;
(c) cost/benefits - social, economic, environmental - as both monetary and non
monetary cost/benefits;
(d) the risk of acting or not acting - the risk of taking action and not taking action
in say the next 10 years because of imperfect information e.g. the cause/effect
relationships are not fully understood.

The report concludes with a summary of the analysis undertaken and outlines which
option best meets the requirements of Section 32 of the RMA.

**2.0** **RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ISSUE**

**2.1** **Background to Issue**

Marsden Valley is located near to well established existing suburban residential
development in Stoke. This existing development has covered the plains and lower
foothills of Stoke but has not penetrated up the valleys. Marsden Valley itself
contains the Stoke Substation at the valley mouth, followed by the Nelson Christian
Academy and the Marsden Cemetery. Further up the valley the use is predominantly
rural in character with some housing. An operating quarry is located at the top end of
the valley, this borders Council reserve land which has been planted over the years by
school and youth groups. The valley has been described as a ‘hidden valley’
(Marsden Valley Landscape Study, Tasman Carter Ltd 2000) and it’s rural and
landscape character noted through landscape studies.


RAD 805233 4


The Nelson Urban Growth Study 2006 (NUGS) considered areas of Nelson which
could be suitable for accommodating future residential growth. Stoke Foothills, of
which Marsden Valley is a part, was identified as one of these areas. Ngawhatu,
Marsden, Enner Glynn, the Upper Brook Valley and the saddles and plateaus in
between were all recognised as being suitable for some level of development as they
can be serviced, and they are close to existing infrastructure and communities.

A large portion of Marsden Valley is owned by members of one family and is subject
to an existing schedule which overlays the current zoning being a mix of Residential
and Rural – Low Density Small Holdings. This allows for development in the
Residential Zone with 1500m [2] minimum site area, and a 2ha average (1ha minimum)
site size in the Rural – Low Density Small Holdings Zone. This density and other
controls are in place to protect the landscape values and rural character of the valley.

Subsequent to the recommendations from NUGS the landowners recognised that the
current density provided for in the plan would not achieve the development vision
outlined in NUGS. A private plan change application was lodged by J & W
McLaughlin, Ashley Trust, B G McLaughlin, G & L Gillard and Echo Holdings Trust
to rezone 124 ha of Marsden Valley land to allow for a higher level of residential
development to occur. This application was for a mix of densities and to include an
area of Suburban Commercial Zoning.

The private plan change application was adopted by Council due to some of the
proposed changes having effect district wide (such as comprehensive housing and
some district wide objectives and policies), and because of a desire to ensure that
zoning, connections and servicing is planned in an integrated manner to include the
remaining rural zoned valleys nearby. A structure plan approach has been undertaken
over a wider area than the original application to ensure these issues can be
adequately addressed. Plan Change 13 forms a part of this wider structure plan to
ensure there is consistency in planning for the wider area. It is being notified
separately to allow the area originally subject to the private plan change application to
proceed ahead of the wider structured planned area. The remainder of the area is to
be notified early 2010.

**2.2** **Identification of Issue(s)**

Rezoning of land within Marsden Valley for an increased level of development raises
issues relating to:

     - Servicing (roading, stormwater, waste water, water supply)

     - Landscape protection

     - Natural Hazards

     - Connections (Walkways/Cycleways, Roading, Biodiversity,
Greenspace)

     - Urban design relating to creation of a new community

     - Efficient use of the land resource

     - Cross-boundary effects
Servicing
The subject land area of Marsden Valley will require the provision of servicing to
allow for its full development. Studies have shown that it is possible to provide these
services. Some upgrades are required ‘downstream’ to deal with increases in traffic


RAD 805233 5


movements and sewerage in particular. The land is proposed to remain, or be
included in the Services Overlay to ensure that all servicing constraints are adequately
addressed prior to development proceeding.

Landscape Protection
The Marsden Valley Landscape Study (Tasman Carter Ltd, 23 February 2000)
specifically assessed the landscape character of the valley. This study identified the
‘strong sense of enclosure’, the lineal corridor effect, ‘the well treed character of the
pasture’, the ‘rural character of the whole valley, but particularly of the hill slopes’
and the ‘hidden nature of Ching’s Flat’. Areas of the most visible slopes and ridges
are currently restricted building areas similar to the Landscape Overlay and with the
purpose of protecting the landscape values as viewed from outside of the valley. This
study formed the basis of the current Plan provisions to protect the landscape values
and character of the valley.

The current proposal will influence the existing identified values of the valley due to
the increase in development density. This is intended to be offset by the protection
and enhancement of vegetation, the provision of open space areas, and biodiversity
and riparian corridors, and the inclusion of the more prominent ridges and slopes in
the Landscape Overlay. The result will be a changed environment when compared to
what exists now but one which provides for the inclusion of natural features and
opportunities in future development.

Natural Hazards

Land stability (including fault lines) and flooding are the main natural hazards present
in Marsden Valley. The fault lines are generally indicated by the Fault Hazard
Overlay, further investigation within the overlay will be required at time of
subdivision and development to determine the exact location of the fault line. Land
instability is an identified issue in areas of Marsden Valley due to a combination of
the fault lines, soil conditions, slope and geology. A geotechnical overview has been
carried out which identifies areas by risk category. Development is theoretically
possible on these different areas of risk but will require the input of geotechnical
specialists at time of development to determine what mitigation measures are
required. When more detailed assessment is carried out based on a specific
subdivision and development proposal it may be found that individual areas are not
able to be built on and would be more suitable for other uses. The Land Management
Overlay has been extended after taking into account the risk categories of various
areas and their susceptibility to erosion and sedimentation issues. The Land
Management Overlay indicates that specific geotechnical assessment (and possible
mitigation) is required to address these issues.

Flooding of the area has been raised through consultation. There are no flood areas or
routes identified which require the addition of the Flood Hazard Overlay. At the time
of subdivision or development the proposal will be assessed for its management of
stormwater to ensure there is no downstream increase in flows beyond an existing or
upgraded systems capacity.

Connections (Walkways/Cycleways, Roading, Biodiversity, Greenspace)
The possibility of potential connections of all types being lost is an issue which can
result from poorly planned and ad hoc development between different land owners.


RAD 805233 6


The structure plan approach ensures that these connections are recognised and
provided for as development proceeds.

A roading connection can be achieved between Marsden Valley and Enner Glynn, and
also from this saddle to Panorama Drive. This achieves permeability in the
community by avoiding the valley being a dead end, and provides options for travel in
different directions. Vehicle and cycle traffic in particular will benefit when
travelling from Marsden Valley to Nelson City by being able to take a more direct
route along Enner Glynn Valley, while also providing options for residents of that
valley (and Panorama Drive) to access amenities and services in Marsden Valley.

Marsden Valley represents the entryway to the Barnicoat walking and cycling tracks,
it also provides the opportunity for connections to Ngawhatu and Enner Glynn
Valleys. Internal connections are also desirable between roads and open spaces
through out the area.

Biodiversity connections provide pathways for plants and animals by linking together
existing and potential areas of predominantly native vegetation. By achieving these
linkages through a planned approach the overall capacity for biodiversity is increased.

Greenspace connections allow areas of open or vegetated land to form a part of the
wider community as it is developed. The land is to be retained as planted or open
space serving the primary purpose of offsetting the surrounding Residential
development by ensuring an open space, or vegetated network is created which is
integral to the community in the area.

Urban design relating to creation of a new community
This proposal will result in the creation of a new community. Currently Marsden
Valley contains approximately 10 houses, it is anticipated that the proposed zoning
could accommodate around 600 households, or 1500 residents. There will also be
additional households located in neighbouring land, such as Marsden Plateau, that
will have ready access to Marsden Valley. As this will be predominantly greenfield
development the ability to create a well designed, attractive and functional community
is available. The proposed zoning allows for a commercial centre surrounded by
higher density housing, then Residential (standard) through to Rural zonings. This
mix of activities and densities provides for a variety of living styles all serviced by a
commercial area in the centre. Open space, trees and biodiversity corridors are
located through out Marsden Valley and will be integral to the final development.

Further Council plan changes, to be notified early 2010, and independent of this
proposal provide the basis and expectation that development will be carried out in
accordance with best practice urban design principles and a design philosophy for the
Suburban Commercial area of Marsden Valley.

Efficient use of the land resource

NUGS, and internal Council investigation, confirms that the residential land supply in
Nelson district is a finite resource. Census figures and predictions show that Nelson’s
population is expected to continue to grow while the number of people per household
is expected to decline. Both these factors increase the pressure on the residential land
supply. Ensuring that any existing or proposed residential land is used efficiently is


RAD 805233 7


important to Council and is an efficient and effective use of a limited land resource.
This efficient use reduces the need for additional rezoning, is more efficient for
provision of required infrastructure, supports existing and proposed neighbourhood
amenities and services, tends to provide a variety of living styles and can create a
more varied and diverse community.

Cross-boundary effects
Consideration has been given in the zoning pattern to potential cross-boundary effects
from the proposed pattern of zoning. This primarily involves the zone boundary of
the Rural and Residential Zones. The zoning pattern proposed involves a graduation
from residential to higher density small holdings through to standard rural zoning.
Effectively this ensures the density of the residential environment is gradually
reduced rather than a standard suburban density more abruptly ending at the rural
interface.

Another important factor is the existing quarry operations in the upper part of the
valley, and the potential sensitivity of residential uses to that. The land most affected
by the quarry operations is also in the upper part of the valley and is in Council
ownership. This land has been included in work as part of the wider structure plan
investigations and is proposed to remain as Open Space and Recreation Zoning. Land
proposed to be rezoned to residential further down the valley is screened from the
quarry operations by the land form. The quarry is permitted to carry out its operations
under an existing schedule in the Nelson Resource Management Plan.

The potential for new residents of the valley campaigning to move the cemetery out of
the valley has been raised as a matter for consideration by local Iwi. Buffer areas
were considered to set housing back from the cemetery however this is not considered
necessary as the closest housing will be on the Ching’s Flat area which current has
consent for development and is setback from the existing cemetery boundaries by an
access road and an existing property.

**3.0** **APPROACH TO PLAN CHANGE**

**3.1** **Reasons for approach**
Plan Change 13 was originally a private plan change application which was
subsequently adopted by Council. This was with a view of expanding the scope of the
Plan Change to include land area in Enner Glynn and upper Brook Valleys to allow a
holistic approach to zoning, connections and servicing in the area. NUGS identified
the Stoke foothills as being suitable for accommodating a level of residential growth.
Ngawhatu Valley, Marsden Plateau and Champion Road/Hill Street North have
already either been rezoned to provide for this or are in the process. By assessing the
potential for growth within the Marsden, Enner Glynn and the upper Brook Valleys
all of the Stoke Foothills area will be planned for the appropriate level of
development. A structure plan approach has been undertaken for this wider area to
ensure that zoning patterns and connections are consistently and appropriately applied
through out the area. This will help to resolve the issues identified in Section 2.2.

**3.2** **Scope**


RAD 805233 8


As noted in section 3.1 the original scope of the Plan Change was expanded to cover a
wider area involving Marsden, Enner Glynn and upper Brook Valleys. This will be
notified in two parts, Plan Change 13 dealing with the majority of Marsden Valley
and a future Plan Change in early 2010 dealing with the remainder of the area.
Council had originally planned to notify the whole structure plan as one to ensure
consistency across the wider area. The change to this intention was accepted as the
planning across the wider area had been carried out and zoning patterns and
connections established as a draft. Therefore this area could be notified separately in
the knowledge that the risk of disjointed planning has been reduced. This suits the
goals of the original applicant for private plan change.

Plan Change 13 does not include the district wide changes originally requested as
these will be the subject of future Council plan changes which are planned or
underway. Examples are changes to the comprehensive housing provisions and to
specific urban design objectives and policies in the district wide section of the Plan.
Council considers that the nature of these changes effect many aspects of
development through out the city and should be addressed within a targeted project.
The two examples given above are being dealt with through Plan Change 14 which is
to be notified in early 2010.

The provisions which will ultimately have effect district wide to be included in this
Plan Change are the inclusion of ‘Biodiversity Corridors’ and ‘Greenspace’ as new
concepts in the Plan. These are new tools which can be applied as required when
areas are rezoned using a structure plan process. This Plan Change includes related
policies and rule requirements to include them on the area of land subject to this
proposal. A section relating to the use of structure plans is also proposed to be
included in the Plan.

All relevant plan zoning and overlays (including the two new concepts above) are
included in this Plan Change to the extent of spatially defining their location in the
area concerned. The relevant zones are Residential, Rural – Small Holdings,
Suburban Commercial and Open Space and Recreation. The relevant overlays are
Riparian, Services, Fault Hazard, Land Management, Landscape, Heritage and
Landscape trees and the Transmission Line Route.

A structure plan is proposed to be included in the Plan. This will be incorporated
through a Schedule within the Residential section of the Plan but which also applies to
the Rural and Suburban Commercial Zones. This will incorporate the items such as
the indicative locations of roads, walkways/cycleways, biodiversity corridors and
greenspace. The schedule itself will include rules specific to this site.

**4.0** **CONSULTATION**

Consultation on this Plan Change has been carried out in accordance with the
Resource Management Act 1991, First Schedule, Clause 3 (1) and (2). In addition the
Council and the original Plan Change proponent have been in regular contact
throughout the process of developing the Plan Change.


RAD 805233 9


Land owners of the wider structure plan area have been consulted in the preparation
of the structure plan and have been given the chance to comment on a draft of the
proposal. This wider consultation included the land subject to this Plan Change.

As a result of consultation to date the location of the Land Management and
Landscape Overlays have been revised, as has the location of the indicative road link
from the Marsden / Enner Glynn Saddle to Panorama Drive. The extent of, and
provisions relating to the Suburban Commercial Zone have been revised in direct
consultation with the original private plan change proponent. Ecological sites were
shown within the Marsden Valley area however these have also been removed as it is
more appropriate to deal with these as a stand alone district wide project.

The most significant change relates to splitting of the land area subject to the original
private plan change application from the wider structure plan. This was carried out in
consultation with, and at the request of, the original applicant.


RAD 805233 10


**5.0** **APPROPRIATENESS IN ACHIEVING THE PURPOSE OF THE RMA**

Section 32(3) of the Resource Management Act 1991 requires that, in achieving the purpose of the Act, a local authority must before any Plan Change is
publicly notified carry out an evaluation of –

(a) The extent to which each objective is the most appropriate way to achieve the purpose of the Act; and

(b) Whether, having regard to their efficiency and effectiveness, the policies, rules or other methods are the most appropriate for achieving the objectives.

Section 32(4) requires that such evaluation must take into account –

(a) The benefits and costs of policies, rules or other methods; and

(b) The risk of acting or not acting if there is uncertain or insufficient information about the subject matter of the policies, rules, or other methods.

The Plan Change seeks to achieve, in accordance with Part 2 of the Resource Management Act 1991, sustainable and efficient urban growth in the Marsden
Valley. In providing for constrained and controlled spatial expansion of the urban boundary, the Plan Change seeks a high standard of urban design,
effective connectivity in service provision, transport routes and walkways, and integration of land use patterns and built and natural environments.

**5.1** **OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES**

consents required for more intensive urban development than anticipated under current rules.
6
Zoning of Land for Urban Growth: The potential combination of zonings is to be assessed later in this section, but assumes some residential, commercial and small holdings

opportunity.
7
Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP): Two-staged resource consent process whereby the NRMP requires a C.D.P for a specified area as a restricted discretionary activity
(subject to consideration of urban design principles, mixed and integrated land use patterns, building design guides, open space and transportation/walkway linkages etc).
Subsequent development within that area must accord with the C.D.P and any associated development objectives or guidelines, and will be assessed as a controlled activity. It
is anticipated that both applications would be non-notified, and the NRMP would need to specifically state that.
8 Structure Plan: is a mapped framework to guide the development or redevelopment of a particular area by defining future development and land use patterns,
areas of open space, the layout and nature of infrastructure (including transportation links), and other key features for managing the effects of development,
often across multiple ownership.
9 Area overlays: A spatial method of showing which areas are subject to various specified attributes such as fault hazards, land management requirements or
heritage items. Usually shown on Planning Maps.

**6.0** **CONCLUSION**

Marsden Valley has retained its existing rural character for a long period of Nelson’s
European occupation. It has however been subject to a number of development
planning exercises in recent years which have all looked to increase the residential
development opportunities. The clearest signal of Council’s further direction for the
Valley was its inclusion in the Nelson Urban Growth Study 2006 (NUGS) as a
residential growth area. This was followed by an approved application for residential
scale subdivision in the Valley and a further application for a private plan change to
further provide for residential use. This proposal also included suburban commercial
zoning to act as a village centre for the area.

The private plan change application was adopted by Council and the scope broadened
to include Enner Glynn and upper Brook Valley’s. The pattern for zoning, overlays
and linkages was developed on this wider scale. Plan Change 13 represents the
original extent of land included in the private plan change application with the
addition of one strategically positioned neighbouring property.

The main issues in developing this proposed Plan Change revolved around zoning
patterns to provide for the direction set in NUGS while recognising the landscape
importance of particular areas, the geotechnical constraints to increased development,
the potential for connections between neighbouring valleys and from existing
residential areas and the preservation of areas of vegetation and native habitat.
Consideration was also given to avoiding placing new areas of housing in positions
where conflict might arise from existing quarry operations, and provision for a mixed
use village centre has been made to ensure a sustainable and living community is
created.

Overall it is considered the proposed Plan Change 13 provides a zoning pattern and
plan provisions which achieves the purpose of the RMA and allows for the creation of
a functional community which responds to the opportunities and constraints of the
environment in which it is situated.

This report summarises the evaluation undertaken by the council of the Plan Change
13 – Marsden Valley Rezoning in terms of Section 32 of the Resource Management
Act.

The main conclusions are that:

  - The objectives are the most appropriate way to achieve the purpose of the Act
as set out in section 5, 6, 7 and 8.

  - Overall, the environmental, social and economic benefits of having the
proposed objectives, policies and rules within the plan outweighs any costs
which may result. Therefore these methods are the most effective and
efficient method of addressing the issues with the land unit and consequently
are the most appropriate method of achieving the objectives.

  - The proposed objectives, policies and rules will allow council to carry out its
functions under section 31, 72 and 74(1) of the Act.
Therefore it is appropriate to incorporate these objectives, policies and rules within
the reviewed sections of the Nelson Resource Management Plan.
