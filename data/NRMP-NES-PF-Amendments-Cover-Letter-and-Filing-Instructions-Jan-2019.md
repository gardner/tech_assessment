**09/10/2018 AMENDMENTS TO THE NELSON RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN**


Please find enclosed a set of amendments for the Nelson Resource Management Plan

(NRMP).


These amendments provide for the following:


  - **National Environment Standards – Plantation Forestry (NES-PF)**


The Ministry for Primary Industries has developed [National Environmental](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2017/0174/latest/whole.html)

                          [Standards for Plantation Forestry (NES](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2017/0174/latest/whole.html) PF) and these came into effect on 1 May
2018. National Environmental Standards (NES) are regulations made under the
Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA).


The NES-PF provides a single set of regulations which apply to commercial
forests that are at least 1 hectare of continuous forest cover, throughout New
Zealand. The Nelson Resource Management Plan (NRMP), which is currently
under review through the Nelson Plan process, has been amended to align with
the new requirements of the NES-PF.
