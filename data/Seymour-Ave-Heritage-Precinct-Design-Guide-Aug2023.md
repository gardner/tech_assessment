**Design Guide** **August 2023**


### **introduction**

##### **DI1 Why a Design Guide?**

The Council, in the development of the Nelson Resource Management Plan (the
Plan), has identified particular residential areas which it considers merit
protection as Heritage Precincts.


The Heritage Precinct recognises that the whole is greater than the sum of the
parts; that a collection of Heritage Buildings, in context, has a greater impact on
the observer and the resident, and has greater heritage value than the same
number of buildings scattered throughout the city. The loss or the
unsympathetic alteration to even a single building detracts from the whole
Precinct rather like a missing tooth from a smile.


An important role of the Guidelines will be educational - to raise the awareness
of the residents and possible developers of the special nature of this Precinct, and
the impact on the street of alterations undertaken on a single building.


The Guide shall ensure that alterations to existing buildings, and new buildings
in the Precinct, are sensitive and enhance the existing visual qualities of the

streetscape.

##### **DI2 General Objectives of the Design Guidelines**


a) To identify the essential heritage values of each Precinct.
b) To set out ways in which these values can be protected and enhanced.
c) To provide education and information for building owners contemplating
changes to their property.
d) To help develop city-wide recognition of the value of these areas to the
Nelson community.

##### **DI3 How the Design Guidelines Operate**


The Design Guidelines operate on three levels:


i) They give a simple description of the history, the visual characteristics and
the special nature of the Precinct, thereby promoting residents’ and the
public’s awareness of, and sensitivity to, our heritage contained within the

Precinct.


ii) Owners and designers will find them a useful reference for preparing
sympathetic designs for new buildings or building alterations.


iii)  In reviewing development proposals the Nelson City Council will use the

Design Guidelines as a measure of how well the intended design fits the
objectives and policies of the Nelson Resource Management Plan.


Buildings within the Precinct will need to meet the requirements of the Plan.
Note in particular the rules in Chapter 7 relating to Heritage Precincts and the

demolition or removal of houses.


The Design Guidelines deal with three different situations:


a) new buildings, including houses;
b) alterations and additions to non-listed buildings; and
c) alterations and additions to listed Heritage Buildings (ie. heritage buildings
listed in the Nelson Resource Management Plan, Appendix 1).


The Guidelines are concerned primarily with the streetscape and the appearance
of the buildings from the street.


The street elevation is obviously part of the streetscape, however the significance
of the side walls and roof to the streetscape depend on such issues as the distance
between houses and the height of a house in relation to its neighbours. This will
be assessed by Council staff on an individual basis. Interior alterations or
additions at the rear, or private areas of dwellings, which cannot be seen from
the street are not covered by the Guidelines.

##### **DI4 Area covered by the Design Guidelines**


A map showing the extent of the Precinct is attached at the end of the
Performance Guidelines, along with a table which identifies the listed Heritage
Buildings.


The Precinct includes non-listed buildings where these form an integral part of
the visual catchment. The aim, over time, is to achieve more sympathetic
development on non-listed sites as these are altered or rebuilt.

### **guidelines - seymour** **ave precinct**

##### **SA1 Historical Context**

The Seymour Avenue Precinct is a group of post villa, early bungalow houses
built in the 1910s and 1920s. Many of the early houses are listed Heritage
Buildings. They present a continuous street setting of an era of Nelson’s past in
an elegant wide streetscape.

##### **SA2 Objectives**


The key design objectives within the Seymour Avenue Precinct are:


a) to maintain the listed Heritage Buildings and encourage the restoration of
the street frontage;


b) to ensure alterations maintain the architectural integrity of listed Heritage
Buildings and enhance the appearance of non-listed buildings in line with
the general streetscape; and


c) to ensure that the design of new houses is sympathetic to the neighbouring
houses and the streetscape, so that the visual qualities of the Precinct are
enhanced.

##### **SA3 Visual Characteristics**


SA3.1 Height


Houses are generally single storey which enhances the openness of the street.


SA3.2 Setback from the Street


There is a consistent building line with the houses built up towards the road
frontage. This provides continuity and links the houses together.


It is important that new houses continue this building line.


SA3.3 Verandahs


The villas have verandahs facing onto the streets. These are an important feature
of the villa design and provide the transition space between the public street and
private home. Residents must be encouraged to maintain the verandahs and the
detailing.


The bungalows appear to have lost their verandahs during previous alterations
and additions. This has detracted from their appearance and has often led to
confusing front entrances.


SA3.4 Garaging


Existing garaging is generally at the rear of the site. This should be maintained
where reasonably practical.


**Nelson City Council** **Seymour Avenue**
**August 2023** **Design Guide**


SA3.5 Fencing


The intimacy of the street depends upon the openness of the houses to the
street. The original low fences are ideal for this purpose, gently defining the
boundary, but maintaining openness. High fences are inappropriate. Materials
should be sympathetic to the houses.


SA3. Materials and Detailing


Timber weatherboards and corrugated iron roofing are the original materials
used on the houses in the street and are very much part of the character of the
houses.


Strong emphasis must be placed on the use of materials and detailing that is
sympathetic to the original design.


SA3.7 Windows and Doors


The window and door design, shape and proportion are
important elements in the design of the houses with the
frames and surrounds creating depth to the facade, detail, and
a shadow line around the openings. Inappropriate
replacement windows can destroy the facade.


New houses should maintain similar proportions, and level of
detail and depth with their windows, to link them with the
existing housing.

##### **SA4 Performance Guidelines**


SA4.1 Listed Heritage Buildings


The listed Heritage Buildings are important elements in the Precinct. They shall
be retained and their values preserved, and:


a) demolition or removal of Group A and B Heritage Buildings requires a
resource consent under the Nelson Resource Management Plan;


b) additions or alterations which impact on the streetscape shall continue the
use of timber weatherboards, corrugated roofing, timber joinery and
detailing all to match the original. Aluminium window joinery may be
used but the proportions shall match the original using details to create
similar pane sizes, depth and level of detail; and


c) houses shall be generally single storey although lofts within the roof spaces
may be allowed where they do not penetrate the roof envelope when
viewed from the street.


SA4.2 Non-listed Buildings


Demolition or removal of non-listed houses in the Heritage Precinct requires a
resource consent under the Nelson Resource Management Plan.


Alterations and additions which impact on the streetscape shall enhance the
building and be in keeping with the Precinct, and:


a) aluminium window joinery may be used for windows seen from the street
but the proportions must be in keeping with the existing houses, using
details to create similar pane sizes, depth and level of detail;


**Seymour Avenue** **Nelson City Council**
**Design Guide** **August 2023**


b) materials may differ from the listed Heritage Buildings, however the
designer shall select materials that complement and enhance the values of
the Precinct;


c) houses shall be generally single storey although lofts within the roof spaces
may be allowed where they do not penetrate the roof envelope when
viewed from the street; and


d) owners are to be encouraged to consider reinstating or creating new front
verandahs when undertaking alterations.


SA4.3 New Buildings


a) shall be designed in such a way as to enhance, complement and be
sympathetic to the existing streetscape;


b) the form and scale of the new work shall be in keeping with the existing
houses when viewed from the street;


c) aluminium window joinery may be used on windows which are viewed
from the street but the proportions must be in keeping with the Precinct,
using details to create similar proportion, depth and level of detail;


d) materials used on new work may differ from the Listed Buildings, however
the designer shall select materials that complement and enhance the values
of the Precinct;


e) houses shall be generally single storey although lofts within the roof spaces
may be allowed where they do not penetrate the roof envelope when
viewed from the street;


f) the addition of verandahs is encouraged;


g) roof lines shall follow the form of existing houses; and


h) the existing continuous facade to the street must be maintained. The front
of new houses should line up with the existing houses.


SA4.4 Garages


Garages are only permitted in the front yard when it is not reasonably practical
to provide a garage at the rear or side. Garages shall be designed to be
complementary to the streetscape in form, detail and use of materials.


SA4.5 Fences


Painted timber pickets or wrought iron are recommended as materials for new
fences, to a maximum of 900mm in height from ground level. However solid
fences are permitted up to 1200mm in height, provided that any portion between
1200 to 1800mm above ground level is an open structure such as trellis, picket
or wrought iron.

### **planning** **applications**

##### **PA1 Application of the Nelson Resource Management** **Plan**

The following activities are permitted (no resource consent is required):


Interior alterations to any building within the Heritage Precinct (unless
otherwise specified in Appendix 1 Heritage Buildings, Places and Objects).


Exterior alterations to any part of a building visible from a street or public space
within the Heritage Precinct, if:


a) the work is redecoration, restoration or insignificant alteration of any
existing fabric or detailing; and
b) it is carried out to the same scale as the original, including window scale,
and with materials similar to, or having the same appearance to those
originally used.


The following activities require a resource consent application:


a) all new buildings; and
b) exterior alterations to any part of an existing building which is visible from
a street or public space within the Heritage Precinct, if the work is not a
permitted activity according to the definition above.


The consent application will be a Restricted Discretionary Activity. Such
applications will be non-notified ie. considered without notification.


The Council’s assessment of the application will be based on:


i) compliance with the Design Guide for the Precinct.
ii) any effects (both positive and adverse) on the heritage values of the entire
Heritage Precinct.
iii) any cumulative or precedent effects on the values of the Precinct.


Note that a resource consent application is also required for the removal of an
unreinforced masonry chimney, a customer connection from a network utility,
or a sustainability addition, where permitted standards are not met (refer to the
Heritage Precinct rules in Chapter 7 of the Plan). A resource consent application
is also required for any proposal to demolish or remove a house within the
Precinct (see PA3 below).

##### **PA2 Consultation**


Early consultation with the Nelson City Council Planning Department is
encouraged to resolve design issues prior to lodging a resource consent
application. Consultation should begin at the commencement of design.


**Seymour Avenue** **Nelson City Council**
**Design Guide** **August 2023**


##### **PA3 Demolition or removal of Buildings**

The Nelson Resource Management Plan should be consulted if demolition or
removal of any house in the Precinct is contemplated, whether or not it is a listed
Heritage Building. Any application for consent to demolish or remove must
satisfy the tests in the Plan.


In addition, any demolition or removal application must be accompanied by a
resource consent application for the intended replacement building.

##### **PA4 Supporting information required**


Resource consent applications for any building development shall include:


a) the street elevation of the building, extended to show the elevations of the
buildings on either side.
b) a written analysis of the manner in which the proposed development
responds to the Design Guide and how it relates to the heritage values of
the Precinct.
