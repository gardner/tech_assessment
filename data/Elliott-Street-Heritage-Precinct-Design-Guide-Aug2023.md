## **introduction**

#### **DI1 Why a Design Guide?**

The Council, in the development of the Nelson Resource Management Plan (the
Plan), has identified particular residential areas which it considers merit
protection as Heritage Precincts.


The Heritage Precinct recognises that the whole is greater than the sum of the
parts; that a collection of Heritage Buildings, in context, has a greater impact on
the observer and the resident, and has greater heritage value than the same
number of buildings scattered throughout the city. The loss or the
unsympathetic alteration to even a single building detracts from the whole
Precinct rather like a missing tooth from a smile.


An important role of the Guidelines will be educational - to raise the awareness
of the residents and possible developers of the special nature of this Precinct, and
the impact on the street of alterations undertaken on a single building.


The Guide shall ensure that alterations to existing buildings, and new buildings
in the Precinct, are sensitive and enhance the existing visual qualities of the

streetscape.

#### **DI2 General Objectives of the Design Guidelines**


a) To identify the essential heritage values of each Precinct.
b) To set out ways in which these values can be protected and enhanced.
c) To provide education and information for building owners contemplating
changes to their property.
d) To help develop city-wide recognition of the value of these areas to the
Nelson community.

#### **DI3 How the Design Guidelines Operate**


The Design Guidelines operate on three levels:


i) They give a simple description of the history, the visual characteristics and
the special nature of the Precinct, thereby promoting residents’ and the
public’s awareness of, and sensitivity to, our heritage contained within the

Precinct.


ii) Owners and designers will find them a useful reference for preparing
sympathetic designs for new buildings or building alterations.


iii)  In reviewing development proposals the Nelson City Council will use the

Design Guidelines as a measure of how well the intended design fits the


**Elliott Street** **Nelson City Council** **3**
**Design Guide** **August 2023**


objectives and policies of the Nelson Resource Management Plan.


Buildings within the Precinct will need to meet the requirements of the Plan.
Note in particular the rules in Chapter 7 relating to Heritage Precincts and the
demolition or removal of houses.


The Design Guidelines deal with three different situations:


a) new buildings, including houses;
b) alterations and additions to non-listed buildings; and
c) alterations and additions to listed Heritage Buildings. (ie. heritage
buildings listed in the Plan, Appendix 1).


The Guidelines are concerned primarily with the streetscape and the appearance
of the buildings from the street.


The street elevation is obviously part of the streetscape, however the significance
of the side walls and roof to the streetscape depend on such issues as the distance
between houses and the height of a house in relation to its neighbours. This will
be assessed by Council staff on an individual basis. Interior alterations or
additions at the rear, or private areas of dwellings, which cannot be seen from
the street are not covered by the Guidelines.

#### **DI4 Area covered by the Design Guidelines**


A map showing the extent of the Precinct is attached at the end of the
Performance Guidelines, along with a table which identifies the listed Heritage
Buildings.


The Precinct includes non-listed buildings where these form an integral part of
the visual catchment. The aim, over time, is to achieve more sympathetic
development on non-listed sites as these are altered or rebuilt.

#### **ES1 Historical Context**

This area contains a well-preserved group of houses ranging in age from the
1860s until the 1940s. The oldest house is No. 18 Collingwood Street, an early
settlers cottage built in 1865. It is thought that No. 14 Collingwood Street was
also built in the mid-1860s and No. 16 Collingwood Street in 1894.


Elliott Street was surveyed in 1912 and known as the Winearls Settlement. The
land had been acquired by the Government for the purpose of housing. The plan
clearly shows the same layout as the street has today. It is unique in Nelson,
being the only workers housing development originating from the Seddon
Government’s Dwelling Act of 1905 and 1910.


The first eight houses were built between 1913-1916 to an Edwardian villa
design (Nos 33, 35 Trafalgar Street; Nos 2, 4, 6, 8, 14, 16 Elliott Street). Three
others were built by the end of the First World War to an identical design (Nos
10, 12, 18 Elliott Street).


Four houses Nos 24, 25, 26, 27 Elliott Street were built in the 1920s.


Nos 20 and 22 Elliott Street were built in an early Bungalow style by 1926.


Of the original 24 houses from the Winearls Settlement, 23 still remain, giving
this street special heritage value.


The remaining four houses on the north side of the street continue the integrity
of the street with their modern bungalow style.


(Information from Submission to Council by Neil Deans 1993.)

#### **ES2 Objectives**


The key design objectives within the Elliott Street Precinct are to:


a) maintain the listed Heritage Buildings and encourage the restoration of the
street frontages


b) ensure alterations maintain the architectural integrity of listed Heritage
Buildings and enhance the appearance of non-listed buildings within the
general streetscape, and


c) ensure that the design of new houses is sympathetic to the neighbouring
houses and the streetscape so that the visual qualities of the Precinct are
enhanced.

#### **ES3 Visual Characteristics**


ES3.1 Height


The street generally consists of single storey houses. This is an important feature


**Elliott Street** **Nelson City Council** **5**
**Design Guide** **August 2023**


of the character of the street and needs to be preserved.


ES3.2 Closeness to the Street and Side Boundaries


The houses are generally very close to the street, particularly on the southern
side, and are also close to one another giving a strong continuous facade to the
street. This is an important feature of the street helping to give an intimate,
strong feeling of the community.


ES3.3 Verandahs


The old villas have wonderful verandahs facing onto the street. These are an
important feature of the villa design and provide the transition space between
the public street and private home. Residents must be encouraged to maintain
the verandahs and the detailing.


ES3.4 Garaging


Existing garages, where provided, are generally at the side or rear of the site.
This allows the streetscape to maintain the strong continuous facade.


ES3.5 Fencing


The intimacy of the street depends upon the openness of the houses to the street.
The original low fences are ideal for this purpose, gently defining the boundary
but maintaining openness. High fences are inappropriate.


ES3.6 Materials and Detailing


The original houses have timber weatherboards, wooden windows and
corrugated iron roofing.


ES3.7 Windowsand Doors


The window and door design, shape and proportion are
important elements in the design of the houses with the frames
and surrounds creating depth to the facade, detail, and a shadow
line around the openings. Inappropriate replacement windows
can destroy the facade.


New houses should maintain similar proportions, and level of
detail and depth with their windows, to link them with the
existing housing.

#### **ES4 Performance Guidelines**


ES4.1 Listed Heritage Buildings


The listed Heritage Buildings are important elements in the Precinct. They shall
be retained and their values preserved, and:


a) demolition or removal of group A and B Heritage Buildings requires a
resource consent under the Nelson Resource Management Plan;


b) additions or alterations which impact on the streetscape shall continue the
use of timber weatherboards, corrugated roofing, timber joinery and
detailing all to match the original. Aluminium window joinery may be
used but the proportions shall match the original using details to create
similar pane sizes, depth and level of detail;


c) houses on Elliott Street shall be single storey, although lofts within the
roof spaces may be allowed where they do not penetrate the roof envelope


**6** **Nelson City Council** **Elliot Street**
**August 2023** **Design Guide**


when viewed from the street; and


d) houses on Collingwood and Trafalgar Street may be two storey however
the roof line and height shall relate and be sympathetic to its neighbours.


ES4.2 Non-listed Buildings


Demolition or removal of non-listed houses in the Heritage Precinct requires a
resource consent under the Nelson Resource Management Plan.


Alterations and additions which impact on the streetscape shall enhance the
building, be in keeping with the Precinct and:


a) aluminium window joinery may be used for windows seen from the street
but the proportions must be in keeping with the Precinct, using details to
create similar pane sizes, depth and level of detail;


b) materials may differ from the listed Heritage Buildings, however the
designer shall select materials that complement and enhance the values of
the Precinct;


c) the addition of verandahs is encouraged;


d) houses on Elliott Street shall be single storey, although lofts within the

## **planning** **applications**

#### **PA1 Application of the Nelson Resource Management** **Plan**

The following activities are permitted (no resource consent is required):


Interior alterations to any building within the Heritage Precinct (unless
otherwise specified in Appendix 1 Heritage Buildings, Places and Objects).


Exterior alterations to any part of a building visible from a street or public space
within the Heritage Precinct, if:


a) the work is redecoration, restoration or insignificant alteration of any
existing fabric or detailing; and
b) it is carried out to the same scale as the original, including window scale,
and with materials and details similar to, or having the same appearance
to those originally used.


The following activities require a resource consent application:


a) all new buildings; and
b) exterior alterations to any part of an existing building which are visible
from a street or public space within the Heritage Precinct, if the work is
not a permitted activity according to the definition above.


The consent application will be a Restricted Discretionary Activity. Such
applications will be non-notified ie. considered without notification.


The Council’s assessment of the application will be based on:


i) compliance with the Design Guide for the Precinct.
ii) any effects (both positive and adverse) on the heritage values of the entire
Heritage Precinct.
iii) any cumulative or precedent effects on the values of the Precinct.


Note that a resource consent application is also required for the removal of an
unreinforced masonry chimney, a customer connection from a network utility,
or a sustainability addition, where permitted standards are not met (refer to the
Heritage Precinct rules in Chapter 7 of the Plan). A resource consent application
is also required for any proposal to demolish or remove a house within the
Precinct (see PA3 below).

#### **PA2 Consultation**


Early consultation with the Nelson City Council Planning Department is
encouraged to resolve design issues prior to lodging a resource consent
application. Consultation should begin at the commencement of design.


**10** **Nelson City Council** **Elliot Street**
**August 2023** **Design Guide**


#### **PA3 Demolition or removal of Buildings**

The Nelson Resource Management Plan should be consulted if demolition or
removal of any house in the Precinct is contemplated, whether or not it is a listed
Heritage Building.


Any application for consent to demolish or remove must satisfy the tests in the
Plan. In addition, any demolition or removal application must be accompanied
by a resource consent application for the intended replacement building.

#### **PA4 Supporting information required**


Resource consent applications for any building development shall include:


a) the street elevation of the building, extended to show the elevations of the
buildings on either side.
b) a written analysis of the manner in which the proposed development
responds to the Design Guide and how it relates to the heritage values of
the Precinct.
