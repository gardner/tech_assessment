## **RMA Planning/Resource Consents**

# **SUBDIVISION**

### **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Can I subdivide my property?**


All subdivisions (including boundary adjustments and unit titles) require
resource consent. The Council must grant subdivision resource consent if the
proposed lots meet minimum sizes, are serviced in accordance with minimum
standards, have sufficient legal and physical access (Council’s Land
Development Manual specifies minimum standards for services and access) and
all other relevant rules and standards are complied with. Applications not
meeting required standards are considered on a case by case basis. The
following table shows the minimum lot sizes for the various zones:


















|Zone|Minimumnetarea(excludingaccesslegs)|
|---|---|
|**Residential**<br>Lower density area<br>Stoke lower density area<br>Higher density area<br>Port/airport effects<br>control overlay|400 m2except…..<br>600 m2<br>1000 m2average with a minimum of 850 m2<br>300 m2 <br>600 m2|
|**Rural**<br>Lower density small<br>holdings area<br>Higher density small<br>holdings area|15 ha except…..<br>3 ha<br>1 ha average with a minimum of 5000 m2 <br>(there are also scheduled sites where different<br>standards apply)|
|**Other zones**|No minimum area|
|**All zones**|Every allotment is a regular shape capable of<br>having a building or activity that complies with<br>the particular zone rules. Existing buildings<br>and access must also comply with relevant<br>zone rules with the proposed changes or an<br>additional land use resource consent is<br>required. Any exposure to natural hazards for<br>the new allotments must be addressed.|

**What will I need to apply for resource consent?**


A completed application form including: an assessment of environmental
effects; a subdivision plan (scheme plan); current (less than 3 months
old) certificate of title (note and address any existing restrictions on the
title); and the required deposit.

_Note – surveyors and planning consultants can assist you with your_

_application or apply on your behalf. They can advise likely total costs for_
_the project._


**What happens after getting consent from the Council?**

It is likely your resource consent will be issued with conditions; many will
require various easements to be registered. These must be included on a
title plan (done by a registered surveyor) that gets submitted to Council
for approval. All other conditions need to be completed and any
development contributions paid before you can apply to Council for a
completion certificate. You can then lodge the title plan and completion
certificate with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) who issue the new
titles. Your lawyer will usually apply to LINZ for the new title.


**What is a Right of Way?**

This is a right given to owners and occupiers sharing a private common
access or driveway to their property (not a public road). When a right of
way is proposed the Council can apply conditions regarding the layout
and formation. Then it is up to the owners/occupiers to repair and
maintain it and abide by the terms for having this shared access as
identified in the easement document.


_**This FAQ only mentions some rules. Other rules and exceptions may also be**_

_**relevant. Do not rely on this FAQ to make decisions about your property.**_

Plan changes occur from time to time and this FAQ will be updated to reflect the

relevant changes as soon as is practicable. In addition to standards and consents

required under the Resource Management Act, the proposed activity may also need

building consent, licences and permits under other legislation such as the Building

and Health Acts.
