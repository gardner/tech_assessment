# **STATEMENT OF EXPECTATIONS**


This Statement of Expectations is intended to inform Nelmac's Board of the shareholders’ high
level strategic direction and performance expectations in advance of your preparation of the
Statement of Intent (SOI) 2023/24. In clarifying our expectations early, we expect that the
passage of your SOI through to acceptance by Council will be more efficient and effective.


**Statement of Intent 2023/24**


Nelson City Council expects their Council Controlled Organisations (CCOs) will treat the SOI as
more than a strict compliance document and will aim for best practice. This will entail an SOI
covering more than the statutory minimum requirements. To be effective, your SOI should tell
the performance story of the organisation, providing a clear and succinct understanding of the
organisation’s purpose, the goods and services it delivers and what success looks like. In line
with the Local Government Act 2002, the councils are particularly interested in efficiency and
effectiveness.


The SOIs must meet the requirements set out in the Local Government Act. The Local
Government Act 2002 set out requirements for SOIs differentiating between matters to be
covered in all SOIs and those that are specific to trading and non-trading CCOs.


We wish to support Nelmac in delivering a good SOI and have assigned a senior manager to
each CCO to assist. Nelmac have been assigned Nikki Harrison in this support role. Nikki is
available to your team to assist throughout the process.


The general expectations for all CCOs are as follows:


1.1 SOIs must include a complete set of summary prospective financial statements for at
least three years (preferably five years) i.e., Statement of Comprehensive Income,
Statement of Financial Position and Cash Flow statement.


1.2 SOIs should disclose measures like Earnings before Interest and Tax (EBIT) and
Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) and balance
sheet ratios where applicable i.e., CCTOs.


1.3 SOIs must fully comply with Schedule 8 of the LGA 2002.


1.4 In the Public Records Act 2005, a local authority includes a (Council Controlled)
(Council-Controlled Trading) Organisation. As such, the requirements of this Act and
its related mandatory Information and Records Management Standard - July 2016
applies for the management, retention, and disposal of records.


1.5 Compliance with legislation and reporting on Health and Safety matters must be given
due emphasis.


1.6 Proposed dividends are to be disclosed along with the dividend pay-out policies, where
applicable.


1.7 Capital expenditure and asset management intentions should be included for at least
the next five years which proactively addresses investment in the fleet and plant.


1.8 CCTOs should use the same information for both managing the business and reporting
through to the councils/shareholders, i.e., the information used for setting targets and
reporting against them for the SOI should overlap and be a subset of the information
used for internal reporting.


1.9 SOIs and other CCO reports should be in a plain style, concise, relevant, accessible
and focused on meeting the needs of the shareholding councils and the public they
represent. The use of graphs, tables and charts is expected to convey both financial
and non-financial information along with trends (past, current and future numbers).


1.10 To be effective the SOI must disclose the performance story for the CCO, providing a
clear and succinct understanding of the CCO purpose, the goods and services it
delivers and what success looks like. Providing a clear message to the boards on these
requirements and other expectations will assist in ongoing improvements in the SOI
and reporting.


1.11 The main aspects of the SOI performance story are:


    - Strategic context


    - Specifying and presentation of the outcome’s framework


    - Main measures and targets, outcomes and objectives


    - Linking the strategy outputs performance together.


1.12 **Risk management** – Shareholders/the councils would like to see documented in the
SOI how the boards are managing risks, including natural hazards and climate change.


1.13 **Sustainability** - Shareholders would like to understand what measures and targets
are in place to address environmental and climate change concerns, including
measures to:


     - Support the transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050;


     Prepare for the impacts of climate change, including assessing key organisational
climate change risks, and


     Minimise waste and support the shift to a circular economy.

1.14 **Health and safety** - Given the requirements of the Health and Safety at Work Act
2015 (the Act), it is appropriate for the councils to set out their expectations in
relation to Health and Safety in the CCOs/CCTOs.


1.14.1 Under Section 44 (3) of the Act elected members do not have a duty to
exercise due diligence to ensure that any Council Controlled Organisation
complies with its duties or obligations under the Act unless that member is
also an officer of that Council Controlled Organisation.


1.14.2 However, as shareholders being a key funder, it is still appropriate to set out
expectations of Health and Safety management in CCOs/CCTOs.


1.14.3 The councils/shareholders expect the Nelmac Board to set appropriate Health
and Safety strategies and policy, understand the nature of risks/hazards
within the business, monitor performance and activities to ensure risk is being
managed and review Health and Safety systems and performance.


1.15 The shareholder requires that CCOs/CCTOs, before making a decision that may
significantly affect land or a body of water, must consider the relationship of Māori and
their culture and traditions with their ancestral land, water, sites, wāhi tapu, valued
flora and fauna, and other taonga.


1.16 **Governance performance** - in order to aid the councils when making decisions on
director remuneration and appointments, the boards should undertake a regular
evaluation of their performance.


1.16.1 The council expect these reviews to be carried out at least once every
eighteen months.


1.16.2 A skills mix analysis is to be part of the regular board reviews and
recommendations for director re-appointments.


1.16.3 The chair of the board should reference this evaluation when making
recommendations on the re-appointment or recruitment of board members.


In addition, Director recruitment must take account of the new requirement in the LGA to
ensure that when identifying the skills, knowledge, and experience required of
Directors consideration is given to whether knowledge of tikanga Māori may be
relevant to the governance of that CCTO.


**General expectation added**


1.17 The Board should ensure that there is ‘no surprises’ communication with the
shareholder on matters which are in the public interest and are not highly
commercially sensitive.


General expectations related to the effects or mitigation of COVID-19 have been removed as
the pandemic effects are expected to lessen over the coming year, most government
mandates have been removed, and COVID-19 management will become business as usual.
Any ongoing impacts on dividend streams should be addressed in the relevant sections of the
SOI.


There are no specific expectations in relation to Nelmac to be included in the SOI.
