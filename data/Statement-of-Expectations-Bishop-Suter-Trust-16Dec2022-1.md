**BISHOP SUTER TRUST - STATEMENT OF EXPECTATIONS**


This Statement of Expectations is intended to inform the Bishop Suter Trust Board of
the Council's high level strategic direction and performance expectations in advance
of your preparation of the Statement of Intent (SOI) 2023/24. In clarifying our
expectations early, we expect that the passage through to acceptance by Council will

be more efficient and effective.


**Statement of Intent 2023/24**


Nelson City Council expects that all its Council Controlled Organisations (CCOs) will
treat the SOI as more than a strict compliance document and will aim for best
practice. This will entail an SOI covering more than the statutory minimum
requirements. To be effective, your SOI should tell the performance story of the
Trust, providing a clear and succinct understanding of the Trust's purpose, the

services it delivers and what success looks like. In line with the Local Government

Act 2002, the Council is particularly interested in efficiency and effectiveness.


The SOI must meet the requirements set out in the Local Government Act (LGA)

2002. The Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Act 2019 made a number of

changes to the LGA that impact CCOs. You will now be familiar with the CCO
provisions of the Act.


Council wishes to support the Trust in delivering a good SOI. We have assigned a

senior manager to each CCO to assist. In your case, the person assigned is Andrew
White, Group Manager Community Services, who is available to your team to assist
throughout the process.

**General expectations to be included in the SOI**


The general expectations for all CCOs are as follows:


1.1 SOis should include a complete set of summary prospective financial
statements for at least three years (preferably five years) ahead, i.e.
statement of comprehensive income, statement of financial position and cash
flow statement.


1.2 SOis should disclose measures like earnings before interest and tax (EBIT);
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA); and
balance sheet ratios, where applicable.


1.3 SOis must fully comply with Schedule 8 of the LGA.


1.4 Under the Public Records Act 2005, a local authority includes CCOs. As such,
the requirements of this Act and its related mandatory Information and
Records Management Standard - July 2016 applies to the management,
retention, and disposal of records.


1.5 Compliance with legislation and reporting on Health and Safety matters must
be given due emphasis.


1.6 Where the Council makes a financial contribution to the operational costs of
the organisation, the CCO should show how it intends to increase non-council
revenue streams.


1. 7 Capital expenditure and asset management intentions should be included.


1.8 CCOs should use the same information for both managing the business and
reporting through to the Council, meaning the information used for setting
targets and reporting against them for the SOI should overlap and be a subset
of the information used for internal reporting.


1.9 SOis and other CCO reports should be in a plain style, concise, relevant,
accessible and focussed on meeting the needs of the shareholding councils
and the public they represent. The use of graphs, tables and charts is expected
to convey both financial and non-financial information along with trends (past,
current and future numbers).


1.10 To be effective, the SOI must disclose the performance story for the CCO,
providing a clear and succinct understanding of the CCO purpose, the goods
and services it delivers and what success looks like. Providing a clear message
to the Board on these requirements and other expectations will assist in
ongoing improvements in the SOI and reporting.


1.11 The main aspects of the SOI performance story are:


      - Strategic context


      - Specifying and presentation of the outcomes framework


      - Main measures and targets, outcomes, and objectives, SMART measures
are preferable in showing performance

      Linking the strategy outputs performance together


1.12 **Risk management:** Council would like to understand through the SOI how
the Board is reviewing and managing risks, including natural hazards, climate
change and pandemics.


1.13 **Climate change and sustainability:** Council would like to understand
what measures and targets are in place to address environmental and
climate change concerns, including measures to:


        Support the transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050

       Prepare for the impacts of climate change, including key organisational
climate change risks

        Minimise waste and support the shift to a circular economy


1.14 **Health and safety:** given the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 (the Act),
it is appropriate for the Council to set out its expectations in relation to Health
and Safety in the CCOs.


1.14.1 Under section 44(3) of the Act elected members do not have a duty
to exercise due diligence to ensure that any council-controlled
organisation complies with its duties or obligations under the Act
unless that member is also an officer of that council-controlled

organisation.


1.14.2 However, as a key funder it is still appropriate to set out expectations
of Health and Safety management in CCOs.


1.14.3 The Council expects the Trust to set appropriate Health and Safety
strategy and policy, understand the nature of risks/hazards within the
business, monitor performance and activities to ensure risk is being
managed and review Health and Safety systems and performance.


1.15 **Governance performance:** In order to aid Council when making decisions
on trustee remuneration and appointments, the Board should undertake
regular evaluation of its own performance.


1.15.1 Council expects this review to be carried out at least once every
eighteen months.


1.15.2 A skills mix analysis is to be part of the regular Board reviews and
recommendations for trustee re-appointments.


1.15.3 The Chair of the Board should reference this evaluation and also
provide a skills matrix for the Board when making recommendations
on the re-appointment or recruitment of new Board members.


1.16 In addition, trustee recruitment must take account of the requirement in the
LGA to ensure that when identifying the skills, knowledge, and experience
required of trustees, consideration is given to whether knowledge of tikanga
Maori may be relevant to the governance of that CCO.

1.17 Council requires that CCOs, before making a decision that may significantly
affect land or a body of water, must take into account the relationship of
Maori and their culture and traditions with their ancestral land, water, sites,
wahi tapu, valued flora and fauna, and other taonga. This is a provision in
the LGA.


**Specific expectations to be included in the SOI**


1.18 It is proposed that the following specific expectations be set out in the SOE
to the Trust:


1.18.1 **COVID-19 recovery:** Asks that the Trust outlines how it will
respond to the future recovery impacts of COVID-19 on arts
organisations, including:


Any expected impacts on visitor numbers and budgets; and


How the Suter's activities contribute to and align with regional
recovery efforts.


1.18.2 **Planning and reporting:** Utilising performance reporting through
the inclusion of quantifiable measures and SMART targets.

relation to fair pay and equal employment opportunities.

view to increasing funding from that source. Describe work to be

1.18.5 **Resilience:** Include in the SOI a risk management plan which details
risks/hazards, mitigation strategies, response and recovery plans
including in relation to cyber-attacks, pandemics and natural hazards.


1.18.6 **Governance:** Include in the SOI reference to how the board will
identify and develop greater diversity and representation of diverse
communities in future succession planning.


1.18. 7 **Risk:** Include in the SOI a specific section on risk. This needs to
address risks arising from the current operating environment,
including inflation, increasing insurance costs, revenue impacts, and
other risks that may be identified by the Trust.


1.18.8 **Assets and security:** Include in the SOI, commentary on Suter
assets and options for security for Council on their investment,
including feedback from the Suter Audit and Risk Subcommittee.


1.18.9 **Fundraising:** Include in the SOI, commentary or data on how
performance evaluation of fundraising would be reported.
