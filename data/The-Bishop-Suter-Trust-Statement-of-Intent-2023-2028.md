##### **1. The Bishop Suter Trust (BST) Statement of Intent 2023-2028**


As a Nelson City Council (NCC), council-controlled organisation (CCO) and in accordance with statutory
obligations of Schedule 8 Section 64 of the Local Government Act 2002, and in response to the NCC’s Statement
of Expectation (SoE) for the BST, this Statement of Intent (SoI) is for the forthcoming financial year 2023/24 and
the following four financial years, ending 30 June 2028.


The BST is the governance body for The Suter Art Gallery Te Aratoi o Whakatū and the purpose of this Statement
of Intent, is to promote public accountability and it is intended as a base against which performance can be
assessed. The five years’ financial forecast is aligned with the BST’s 5-year strategic plan objectives and targets,
and this SoI identifies the funding required to deliver on those objectives and targets, in addition to responding
to the NCC’s Letter of Expectation.


The BST’s core funding is provided by NCC, and Tasman District Council (TDC) also contributes funding. BST
services are provided with a combined Nelson and Tasman regional focus; and align with both Councils’ joint
community outcomes as outlined in their respective LTPs.

##### **1.1. Executive Summary: The Suter, a vibrant destination where art matters**


The Trust’s aspiration is to be a visual arts destination of the highest quality, where _**Art Matters**_ - a place which
will excite, engage and inform our community through art experiences, and that will be a leading attraction for
visitors to the region.





We will deliver a range of exhibitions, activities, events and structured education programmes and will develop
our nationally significant collection. An ongoing project that enhances the public’s enjoyment of and access to
the collection, is the further development of The Suter’s Tasman ArtWalk in Richmond, Motueka and beyond.


We want to strengthen our collaborations- and the exciting synergies these bring, internally with our lessees,
Nelson Suter Art Society, Friends of The Suter and with supporter partners, iwi, other arts, cultural, tourism,
business and not-for-profit organisations in our region. This way we will get the most out of all aspects of The
Suter whilst also contributing to the well-being of the Nelson/ Tasman community.


We are focusing on regenerating the vibrancy, activities and audience levels that were a feature of pre-COVID
times. We have proven our resilience and adaptability and have contingency plans that will enable us to refocus
our exhibitions and events programmes, education delivery and revenue expectations should we need to. An
advantage of a smaller organisation is agility: the nimbleness to respond and innovate so that we can provide a
special place of inspiration, enjoyment and connection for locals as well as being a drawcard, and a reason for
people to come to Nelson.


Our approach to sustainability is to take a holistic view from ensuring that we have sufficient resource in reserve
to withstand existential threats, to focussing in on the environmental impact of our activities and those of our
business partners, and being a good kaitiaki of our people, infrastructure and the taonga and heritage in our care.


Financial resilience will be achieved by managing our core activities as efficiently and effectively as possible,
building revenue streams from both existing and future commercial activities to off-set a proportion of the dayto-day operations’ expenditure. Any surplus that may be generated is channelled into endowment funds to- grow
and care for our collection, protect our valued education services, enable special projects to occur and to ensure
our facilities are kept well maintained and fit-for-purpose. COVID -19 impacted venue hire revenue, but we

intend to rebuild this now that restrictions have lifted.


P a g e | **4**


We will present an annual programme of changing exhibitions, enhanced with activities that encourage the
development of art and its appreciation in the community. Although we have scheduled exhibitions for the next
24-30 months ahead, we also build-in a degree of flexibility in case we have to review and re-jig aspects of the
programme [1] . Our contingency strategies include exhibitions that can be called up on short notice, extending
exhibition seasons, and creating shows from our collection and/or community. Included in the forward
programme are exhibitions that compliment local city or region wide events and festivals. These include Te
Ramaroa, Nelson Arts Festival, The Adam International Chamber Music Festival, and local initiatives to profile art
forms such as ceramics and jewellery.


We have committed to mounting at the minimum one toi Māori exhibition per annum. In 2023 an iwi led guest
curated exhibition _Kanohi Kitea (the seen face)_ will be presented.


_Fire and Earth_, one of The Suter’s signature biennale exhibitions will feature across the summer of 2023/4, and a
variation on our other biennale, The Suter Contemporary Art Project will be presented.


Learning opportunities will be provided for all ages, with an emphasis on providing high quality, structured
learning experiences delivering Enriching Local Curriculum [ELC]. The Suter has a 3.5 year contract with the
Ministry of Education to deliver ELC, from early childhood to year 13 students. At the start of our new contract [2]
the availability of our Suter Educator-led education services increased from 3 days to 3.5 days per school term
week. This will enable our target of delivery to 4,000 students | ākonga to be achieved.


The Gallery aims to keep providing a variety of community hands-on learning opportunities with after school and
adult art classes, school holiday programmes as well as exploring more community outreach ventures particularly
focussing on Tasman District audiences in Tasman venues.


With a staff member dedicated to marketing and communications, regular and more effective promotion is
possible via social media channels, our website and various other means, as well as engaging in collaborative
region wide promotions and/or with partner organisations. We are expanding our audience base, through our
exhibitions, educational activities and by holding special events. Converting visitors to supporters is an aim
which may manifest as repeat visitation, joining our Friends of The Suter, getting involved as a volunteer or
becoming a Legacy Patron. We also want to focus on diversifying our audience, for example working on ways to
attract and involve more under 30s, attract a wider range of ethnicities, the latter potentially linking with
initiatives of the Shared Communities Consortium [3] .


We will prudently build the Collection through acquisitions, funded by patronage, benefaction and fundraising
and through acceptance of donated art works.


Enhancing how people can access and enjoy our collection is an important objective, whether that’s through
continual development of The Suter Collection On-Line, exhibitions, publications or through other projects that
get our collection out in front of the public. Inspired by the success of the Nelson City Centre ArtWalk we have
initiated The Suter’s Tasman ArtWalk with installations in Richmond, Motueka and other sites in the Tasman
region in the planning.


Another aspiration is to work towards commissioning major public art works in significant locations that will put
The Suter and Nelson ‘on the map’ for art lovers and encourage people to visit and explore the region. First steps
include working closely with iwi to develop a kaupapa for this long-term project.


1 For example, we have in our plan exhibitions that include out of region artists, the impacts of COVID-19 and severe
weather events, economic factors can affect travel and freight- sometimes we may have to adjust start times, openings etc.

2 Our ELC contract began 1 July 2022. It replaces what was previously known as Learning Experiences Outside the Classroom

P a g e | **5**


As The Suter enters its seventh year post-redevelopment; our Long-Term Maintenance Plan [LTMP] comes into
play. The LTMP informs and drives our capital, renewals, repairs, and maintenance programme. This aspect of
our operating expenditure increases as a percentage of our total revenue, from 0.8% in 2020 to 5.7% in 2023.


As renewals and take place we intend to draw down funds held by NCC and The Suter specifically for this
purpose. [4]


In addition, we have tendered most supply and contracted work, resulting in sharper pricing, to manage rising
costs for facilities’ maintenance and other overheads’ management, against a climate of increasing costs and
economic impacts from major climatic events.


The Nelson floods of August 2022 heavily impacted The Suter, our lessees and visitation. We immediately
established a project team including expert advisors. The project team’s scope includes identification of all actual
and potential risks and potential solutions to manage, mitigate, minimise, or eliminate these risks to our facilities,
archive storage, and operations. This will involve the need to work closely with Council.

##### **1.2. Organisational description:**


The Suter® Art Gallery Te Aratoi o Whakatū is governed by The Bishop Suter Trust, incorporated under the
Charitable Trusts Act 1957, and is a not-for- profit entity with charitable status, established to manage and
operate on behalf of the Council a public art gallery service for the benefit of residents of Nelson and Tasman
regions and the public generally.


The Suter is a council-controlled organisation whereby the NCC has the right to directly appoint 1 or more of the

trustees.


We are guided by our Trust Deed, which requires the Trust to “manage the assets and facilities, acquire and
manage the collections and to operate them for the benefit of the region;… recognising the special nature of the
history of the region and role of tangata whenua as kaitiaki of taonga Māori and their special contribution to the
art and identity of the region.” [5]

##### **2 Nature and Scope of the Activities to be undertaken:**


The NCC’s expectation is that the activities of The Suter will engage the regional community and provide a service
that is of value to that community as both the owners and customers. Further, the NCC expects that the
activities of The Suter will support the objectives of He Tātai Whetū Whakatū Nelson Arts and Creative Strategy,
and Arts, Heritage and Events Activity Management Plan| Mahere ā-Hapori 2021 – 2031.

Also, in line with the NCC’s goal to reduce annual carbon emissions The Trust must ensure its activities are
conducted sustainably, consider environmental impacts and instigate mitigations.

Te Aratoi o Whakatū expresses in Te Reo Māori that the Gallery is providing a pathway to the arts for the
Nelson region and we see our purpose as being- to make art matter

**Our vision:** To be a high quality visitor destination where art matters

#### **2.2 Key Priorities:**


**1** **To be a vibrant visual arts destination of national importance**

**2** **To excite, engage and inform our community through art experiences**

**3** **To ensure a sustainable future for The Suter**

**4** **To embrace the past and preserve our artistic heritage**


2.2.1. **To be a vibrant visual arts destination of the national importance**
**To be achieved by:**


P a g e | **7**


    - Optimising the use of The Suter’s facilities and resources, in order to achieve its objectives,


    - Building the capability of the organisation: people, facilities, funding streams and processes - to
ensure resilience, operational sustainability and programme innovation,


    - Working in partnership with key stakeholders and other potential funders and supporters to realize
objectives,


    - Diversifying and broadening our audiences,


    - Undertaking arts related activities and exciting marketing that will attract and engage the public,
increasing visitor numbers,


    - Ensuring our facilities, plant and equipment are fit for purpose through maintenance and renewals as
per The Suter’s Long Term Maintenance Plan,


    - Actively identifying and addressing risks through adaptation, mitigation or elimination including cyber
threats, local climate change impacts, health & safety and to our resourcing,


    - Improving our carbon footprint by implementing sustainability and waste minimisation measures.


**Honouring the kaupapa of the Memorandum of Understanding [MoU] with Ko Te Pouāranga** : This MoU
is due for review. Major joint initiatives include the development of the kaupapa and the selection and
commissioning pathways for the sculpture project; and curatorial support for the toi Māori exhibitions.

**Identification of Risks and mitigation strategies** : The Suter has a comprehensive Risk Management
Framework and Register and this is a standing agenda item of the BST Audit Risk & Remuneration
Committee. It is continually reviewed, to ensure currency, that risks and hazards are identified, and
strategies and interventions are developed to eliminate, mitigate or minimise these: **Appendix IV**
summarizes the Register which covers resourcing, reputation, cyber, assets including building and
collection, health and safety, natural and external threats.


**Facilities Management:** Ensuring that the facilities are attractive, fit-for purpose, resilient and well
maintained.

**Appealing to diverse audiences and audience generation:** Marketing and promotion is focussed on
generating awareness of The Suter as a visitor destination, creating excitement around our programmes
and events; celebrating our partnerships, supporters, and community engagements, encouraging revenue
generation, venue hire, benefaction and support. It is also about growing a committed audience base.


The visitor journey experience is critical to our success; encouraging return visitation and converting our
visitors into committed supporters who are taken along a deeper relationship journey with The Suter and
move from visitor to Friend, volunteer and/or benefactor.


In the last couple of years emphasis has been on building long term partnerships [6] and other supportive
relationships; and acknowledging this support through special sponsors’ events, activities and

involvement.

A key objective is to **build revenue generating opportunities** including retail in The Suter Shop; classes and
other activities, public programmes and services, and post-COVID re-invigorating venue hire using the Jane
Evans Foyer, The Suter Theatre and other spaces in the complex.


The Suter is open every day except some public holidays [7], the exhibition galleries from 9.30am – 4.30pm
whilst other aspects of the facilities such as the Pastorius Waller Theatre @ The Suter may be in use from
8am – 11.30pm.


**2.2.2. To excite, engage and inform our community through arts’ experiences.**
**To be achieved by:**


    - Providing a **programme of exhibitions** that appeal to a variety of audiences, and that present the

visual arts in its many forms by local, national and where possible, international artists.


The Suter provides a programme of regularly changing exhibitions and these are mounted in 3 large
exhibition galleries, the intimate Contemplation Gallery and in other spaces inside and outside the
building. [8] In 2023/4, as part of our exhibition programme, we will hold the second in a series of iwi led toi
Māori exhibitions, mount our signature biennale exhibitions _Fire and Earth_ featuring Top of The South
ceramics and an in-house curated contemporary art exhibition “Home Give Me Shelter”; present themed
exhibitions from The Suter’s collection including a fourth in a series of abstraction exhibitions. We will host
an exhibition of historical and contemporary paintings by major New Zealand artists from the Fletcher
Trust collection. Coinciding with Te Ramaroa we will hold a solo exhibition by Tasman based artist Kāryn
Taylor who uses light and digital technologies to manipulate our perceptions.


    - P **roviding innovative educational opportunities**


The Suter has a very well-regarded education service, that offers curriculum related and structured
learning programmes for 0-13 students of the Nelson/Tasman region, based on Suter exhibitions, site,
history, collection, and the surrounding local environment.


Our education programme delivery has increased to 3.5 days per week per school term, and we have
developed new hybrid delivery modes of teaching using digital technologies. We have a 3.5 year Enriching
Local Curriculum [ELC] contract with the Ministry of Education which runs until December 2025.


The Trust has also secured additional operational support for our education programmes from NBS, a great
example of a new and valued sponsorship partner.


We also hope to be able to add to the Education Endowment Fund, to ensure our valued education service

can be sustained into the future.


The Suter also delivers a variety of activity-based art classes and art related courses for audiences of
various ages and abilities including after-school programmes such as Suter Kids Club (SKC), adult art classes
and holiday programmes as resourcing and demand allow.


Illustrated talks, lectures, floor-talks, opening previews, workshops and other events are held to
complement and support projects and the exhibitions’ programme.


7 Currently days not open include Christmas Day, New Year’s Day, Good Friday.
8 A further gallery space, the McKee Gallery is occupied by the Nelson Suter Art Society (NSAS) who run their own

programme of regularly changing exhibitions, the majority of which showcase work by Nelson/Tasman region artists. 2
exhibitions per annum, _Spring_ and _Autumn_ are more comprehensive and involve input from BST staff.


P a g e | **9**


Volunteers are important to The Suter, contributing to The Suter’s visitor experience, welcoming and
introducing exhibits, aspects of the building and The Suter’s rich history. They also make a significant
contribution to archives management, enquiries’ research, fundraising, event assistance and other tasks.
Volunteers receive structured training, plus Sneak Peeks where they are introduced to each new
exhibition, and invitations to events to acknowledge their contribution to visitor hosting. Post COVID we
hope to recruit more volunteers and see this as an opportunity to potentially engage with the many
migrant communities of Whakatū.


**2.2.3** **To collect and preserve, record, communicate and display** **our artistic heritage**

To be achieved by:


   - Being the recognised custodian of Nelson/Tasman region’s artistic heritage by developing the

Collection, sharing information and increasing knowledge of the Collection.

    - By profiling aspects of the Collection and Nelson/Tasman regions’ artists through exhibitions, loans,

public programmes, publications, website, and projects such as The Suter’s Tasman ArtWalks.


Collection development is focussed on **acquiring works that are regionally relevant and nationally**
**significant**, with over-arching collection themes of dislocation and the environment guiding acquisition
decisions, and with collection growth carefully managed cognizant of resources and of storage capacity.


The Potton Family gallery space is now primarily devoted to themed Collection based exhibitions.


The research from exhibition development will be disseminated by publishing, enhancing our collection
on-line information, in blogs and social media posts.


**2.2.4** **Connecting with our community;** **partnerships that** **grow** **The Suter**

To be achieved by **:**


    - Honouring Te Tiriti

    - Developing partnerships which contribute to the delivery of programmes, development of the

Collection, resources, and other projects on and off site: - in particular for the ongoing operational
and collection acquisitions’ funding [9] of The Suter, exhibitions and education services.

    - One way The Suter is supported is through memberships: including The Friends of The Suter and the

Legacy Group. Our aim is to increase The Friends memberships and provide activities and benefits

to those who are generous in their support for the Gallery.

    - Contributing to the fulfilment of He Tātai Whetū Whakatū Nelson Arts and Creative Strategy by

providing leadership in the area of the visual arts. Suter staff and Trustees have expertise that can be

called upon to contribute to arts endeavours that enhance Nelson/ Tasman’s reputation and achieve

economic, cultural, and social outcomes.

    - Doing good beyond our walls by engaging with other community organisations to help them fulfil

their objectives.


9 All collection purchases are funded through fundraising, bequests and other forms of benefaction

##### **4.  Operating Framework** **4.1.  Background**


The Suter has a long and rich history dating back to 1895 when Amelia Suter, widow of Nelson’s second Bishop,
Andrew Burn Suter, gave a collection of art works and land to encourage the establishment of an art gallery, as a
memorial to her late husband. That gallery opened in May 1899 on its current site adjacent to Queen’s Gardens.


In 2008 the Bishop Suter Art Gallery Restructuring Act (2008) repealed The Bishop Suter Art Gallery Trustees Act
(1896) enabling the establishment of the current Bishop Suter Trust. The Suter then become a CCO of the Nelson
City Council.


In early 2015-2016 a major redevelopment occurred with new state-of-the art facilities built, designed by Marc
Barron of Jerram Tocker + Barron, a Nelson based firm, and Warren & Mahoney. The original Bishop Suter
Memorial gallery was earthquake strengthened and restored. This Project was a partnership between the Bishop
Suter Trust and Nelson City Council.


Community involvement in The Suter is very evident in the significant financial contributions to that
Redevelopment, to the Collection and other projects. Over 90% of items in The Suter’s collection have been
donated or acquired through benefaction. Of national significance, the Collection includes historical and
contemporary art works and ceramics by New Zealand artists, plus some international works.

##### **4.2 Governance, stakeholders and staffing**


**The Bishop Suter Trust** has been formed by the NCC, as a charitable trust, and incorporated under the Charitable
Trust Act (1957) to manage and operate The Suter. As a CCO, the NCC are responsible for appointing the 6
members of the Board, including a representative of Ko Te Pouāranga. The President of the NSAS attends exofficio. Trustees are appointed for three-year terms.

The Bishop Suter Art Gallery Trust Board has a longstanding relationship with the **Nelson Suter Art Society Inc.**, a
voluntary run incorporated society which has traditionally occupied part of The Suter premises. The relationship

is defined in deeds between the BST and NSAS.

**Friends of The Suter** comprises 450 plus memberships of which approximately a third are Life memberships. It is
not an incorporated society. Members receive regular e-newsletters, and a range of events and activities are
held to advance Friends’ appreciation of art in general as well as support for The Suter. Reciprocal membership
benefits are agreed with Christchurch Art Gallery and Auckland Art Gallery.


**The Legacy Group** are patrons of The Suter who are significant benefactors. Their contributions are for specific
Suter programmes, projects such as the biennial Suter Contemporary Art Project or they may have made
significant gifts of artworks to the Collection. They receive regular updates and are involved in projects, plus
events are held especially for them, in recognition of their generosity, interest and support.


**Ko Te Pouāranga** is the name of the group comprising representatives from each of the six recognised mana
whenua Iwi organisations of Whakatū, Motueka and Mohua. A Memorandum of Understanding reviewed every
3 years establishes principles of partnership and confirms full, permanent as of right, Māori representation on
the Board of The Suter as outlined in the Trust Deed. KTP hui tend to be held in conjunction with Te Tai Ao Komiti
(Tasman Bays Heritage Trust), at least 4 times per annum.

**Staffing:** (as at 1 March 2023) The Suter’s staffing complement approximates to 8.1 Full Time Equivalents [F.T.E’s]
across 7 day weeks; comprising 5 full- time staff [11] and 6 part time. This increases with casuals and contractors to


11 For the purposes of this document Full Time is 37.5+ hrs


P a g e | **16**


cover venue hire and visitor services, learning programmes, graphic design, exhibition installation and
maintenance and theatre technical expertise. The BST implemented the Living wage in 2021.


**Volunteers:** The Suter has had a formalised volunteer programme since 2016. Volunteers are rostered front-ofhouse as visitor hosts, assisting with events and activities such as openings and fundraising; conducting visitor
surveys; and behind-the-scenes with archives, library and collection research projects.

##### **5. Operating Environment**


**The following factors are likely to influence The Suter over the next five years:**


**Visitor trends:** Prior to COVID-19 The Suter’s annual visitor target was 130,000 visitors. COVID-19 significantly
impacted tourism and the economy, so we modified our target for visitors to 100,000. International travel has
resumed and we are now seeing many more international tourists visiting the gallery, a trend we expect to
continue.  We also anticipate a recovery of audience levels for regional events such as festivals, our own events
programmes, cinema and the performing arts. The following graph indicates on average a gradual pick up in
visitation ( _dark green is 2022/2023 financial year and does not include June 2023_ )







Normally in the peak tourism season (late November-April) travellers to the Nelson region make up
approximately 60% of The Suter’s visitors. We continue to focus on increasing awareness of The Suter through
[social media channels, our website www.thesuter.org.nz, and through tourism media. We also need to make](http://www.thesuter.org.nz/)
sure that we attract our community, and a focus now is on broadening and diversifying our audiences.


Apart from our exhibitions, public programmes and educational activities, and collaborating with city wide
ventures, historically mid-winter events such as the NZ International Film Festival [12], held in our Theatre have
been important for ensuring a consistent flow of visitors year-round.


The graph below of monthly visitation split into general gallery visitors and those attending films, hirers’ events,
NSAS openings etc. This too has a seasonal aspect to it, the latter diminishing in December and January, with
activity tending to resume mid- late February.


12 COVID disrupted the NZIFF and in 2022, it had to be relocated to State Cinemas (who screen it) due to the flooding and
consequent damage to The Pastorius Waller Theatre @The Suter


P a g e | **17**







The graph below is of Suter visitors by activity- general visitors (blue), education and tours (orange), Suter public
programmes and events (grey) and venue use (yellow). It shows the impact of COVID-19 (2018/19 f/y is preCOVID). The current financial year is included- noting it is _11 months_ compared to the other full years, there is
evident, an increase in Suter general visitation and education. The floods impacted venue hire [13], this is slowly
recovering.







**Collecting:** The Suter intends to continue developing its collection, by raising funds, using invested fundsgenerally tagged bequests and accepting relevant gifted art works. We also want to increase awareness of the
collection, as the more Collection items get known and recognised, the more they are sought out and treasured.
A collection of national significance with iconic pieces is both a source of local pride and a drawcard for out- of
town visitors.


13 The floods damaged the Suter Theatre and it was out of commission August, September and part of October 2022


P a g e | **18**


Inspired by the success of Suter and Make/Shift Spaces Nelson City Centre ArtWalk project, putting large scale
images of Suter collection artworks on city walls, we have been developing ArtWalks in the Tasman region,
beginning in Richmond and Motueka, with plans to extend to other locations, as fundraising allows us to achieve.


Our collection also includes art works that are able to be displayed outdoors and to this end The Suter intends to
fundraise to commission major public art works, as significant public sculptures can also become tourism

drawcards.


**Resourcing:** One of The Trust’s key endeavours is to build income streams in addition to local government grants;
Even though the current economic unease means that the philanthropic ‘space’ is challenging  we have achieved
and are forecasting increases in our non-grant monies during this SoI period. Self- generated revenue comes
from leases, venue hires, Ministry of Education ELC contract and life-long learning activities, sales (retail and
commissions), grants and sponsorships. Additional income is derived from memberships, donations,
events/activities and specific fundraising ventures.


In the last quarter of calendar year 2022, we have seen an upward trend in venue hire business for our Theatre,
Jane Evans Foyer, Mina Arndt Education Room and Library/Board Room compared to the previous Covid affected
years, when public safety restrictions virtually precluded live performances, conferences, lectures and films being
able to occur. The conference/ event space is showing every sign of recovery but there is somewhat of a lag with
performing arts. We intend to proactively develop packages that make the most of the unique character and
offerings of The Suter and/or are hybrid offerings that connect on and off-site audiences.


The Suter’s Store has a well-deserved reputation as a destination for unique, locally sourced and crafted items,
supplemented with other quality art and exhibition related merchandise quality in a range of prices that appeal

to local and international visitors alike.


**Climate Change and resiliency** : The Nelson floods of August 2022 resulted in damage to The Suter building,
infrastructure and plant as well as disrupting our and lessees’ abilities to trade. Post this event – we immediately
established a project team to not only manage the de-contamination and building reinstatement programme,
but to also consult with a team of experts to advise the Trust and NCC on how to eliminate or mitigate the
ongoing risks and the types of serious outcomes that we experienced during August to October 2022. The NCC
will be a key stakeholder and critical member of that project team as we seek to lessen our exposure and
vulnerability to flooding, as well as protecting and preserving the valuable community asset that The Suter is.


**Sustainability:** In its drive to a more sustainable future The Suter is concentrating on reducing power
consumption and sourcing regenerative power sources. The Suter team also operate various “best practice”
procedures for recycling, waste minimisation, sourcing and supporting environmentally friendly products and
manufacturing methods throughout the operation.


Other opportunities include partnering with other organisations and initiatives that support broader community
sustainability outcomes.

##### **6. Accountability** **6.1  Information to be provided to Nelson City Council**


**Half Yearly**


By 28 February a six-month report covering Statement of Financial Performance and Statement of Financial
Position, performance against targets, commentary on activities, cash flow statement, and other such
information as the Trustees consider necessary to enable an informed assessment of the Trust’s performance
during the period being reported.


P a g e | **19**


**Annually:**


Within three months of the end of the financial year the Trustees shall deliver to NCC an annual report which
fulfils the requirements of Section 67 of the Local Government Act 2002, prepared to comply with International
Financial Reporting Standards and audited financial statements in respect of the financial year.

##### **7. Prospective Financial Statements** **7.1. Introduction:**


The Suter’s Statement of Intent covers the period 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2028. The financial information
contained in the Statement of Intent has been prepared to assist the NCC consider The Suter’s planned
performance.


The prospective financial statements are based on assumptions as to future events that The Suter may
reasonably expect to occur at the time when this information was prepared. Actual results may vary, and this
variation may be material.

##### **7.2 Statement of Significant Assumptions**


The SOI shows that there will be net losses in general funds after depreciation. Accordingly, we need to build
revenue to reduce and eliminate this over time. The extent to which we can achieve that in post-Covid times and
in the current difficult financial climate will be closely monitored, and we will continue to seek grants,
sponsorship and fundraise for future projects.

**7.2.1. Fiscal support from local authorities:** The Suter is a Nelson City Council CCO initiated with NCC’s
commitment to long term funding support that was set in a Memorandum of Understanding. The TDC also
provides an annual contribution and the basis of this commitment is set out in the TDC’s LTP; this grant is not
currently annually adjusted for CPI. To the extent the actual monies allocated from both councils is less or more
than that set out, The Suter will need to adjust its activity levels accordingly.


**7.2.2. Other revenues:** Other revenues reflect forecast visitor activity levels consistent with historic trends,
obligations of lessees and the restrictions.


**7.2.3.** **Special Purpose Funds** The Suter has historic and ongoing bequests, gifts and contributions that generally
have restrictions on use. These funds are shown separately on the balance sheet.


**7.2.4. Operating Expenditure** Operating expenditure is generally forecast to continue similar to recent trends
and adjusted for known factors and /or inflation.


**7.2.5. Capital Expenditure** The majority of Capital Expenditure during the period will relate to the ongoing asset

renewals programme and our Long-Term Maintenance Plan (LTMP).


**7.2.6. Inflation:** A 3.5% increase to the NCC grant has been factored in. Given the cost increases associated with
operational expenditure including major overheads of personnel wage/salary costs, energy, insurance, cleaning,
and annual audit; plus to consumables, freight, materials for collection and exhibitions, and a limited ability to
increase income from leases, we have taken a conservative approach in the 2023/2024 Budget and throughout
the following 4 years of the extended SoI period. Collectively the cost increases applied (CPI) over the SoI period
range from 2% to 6%.


Note that we have also included a CPI increase on the NCC grant from the 2025 year onwards.


P a g e | **20**


**7.2.7. Trustees’ Estimate of Trust Value:** The Trustees estimate that the opening balance of funds in the annual
accounts will represent the value of the Trust. The Trustees will advise NCC on an annual basis if they believe the
value to differ materially from this state. The audited opening equity at 9 August 2008 is $9,593,656 [14] .


**7.2.8. Heritage Assets:** This is represented by the Collection. Additions to the Collection will be recorded at
either purchase price or market valuation for donated art works. The Collection is not regarded as a realisable
financial asset and valuation is carried out for the purposes of insurance and compliance with NZ IFRS.

##### **7.3  Notes to the 2023-2028 SOI Budgets:**


**Summary of position:**

There are clearly upcoming challenges in the next few years and we will remain as agile as possible, to respond as
necessary, in this difficult financial landscape. However, given the forecasted results within our Statement of
Intent 2024-2028, this may necessitate reviewing our priorities and all operating activities - balancing meeting
our obligations to Nelson City Council and the local community, with maintaining a financially and operationally
sustainable organisation.

In recent years we have established a solid foundation of resource and expertise with new revenue streams to
slowly grow our non-grant income. We have also proven our ability to operate highly efficiently during Covid -19
levels and the flooding event.

Nevertheless this is stretching already tight resources. For instance, we are open 362 days a year and operate our
public exhibition programme, education department, events, visitor services, retail and essential support roles
with an extremely small team of 8.1 FTE-; and our operating costs are managed bottom up. We constantly review
our operations for efficiency mindful of meeting our performance and financial objectives.

The upcoming Budget 2024 will provide an operating cash surplus of $103,477.

Our top 5 risks to achieving that position are as follows:


I. Pressure on achieving acceptable wage and salary improvements that balance retaining our valued staff

team, being cognisant of market conditions and meeting financial commitments (included in SoI budget

data).

II. Insurance costs or ability to continue with current insurers - risk to current cost estimates could be

$10,000+. We are attempting to limit this with a proactive and determined approach of open

communications with our Insurers and providing a detailed description of our post-Flood Project Team

work to provide confidence.

III. R&M blow out - unexpected breakdowns or failures have unknown values. Anything above $30,000

would mean a forced draw down from investments.

IV. Ensuring our sophisticated air and humidity control system (HVAC) is operable, may involve urgent chiller

unit replacements - risk is minimum $50,000, potentially higher. This risk is being proactively monitored

and managed through our Asset & Infrastructure sub-committee.


Aligned to this, it is critical that NCC reinstates allocating funds towards the 50% shared depreciation fund for
capital, renewals and large-scale maintenance. This was put on hold for a 3-year period from 2022 and resumes
not in the 2023/2024 f/y, but in Budget 2024/2025 year. The following financial pages clearly illustrate how

critical this is to The Suter.


14 This is the date when The Bishop Suter Trust assumed responsibility for governance of The Suter Art Gallery


P a g e | **21**


There will be costs associated with the project to reduce The Suter’s vulnerability to flooding and improving its

resilience.

**Financial Statement accompanying notes**

 - The budgets separate activities between Operating and the Special Purpose Funds which have independent

and tagged purposes; these are:

  - Cuthbertson Fund – a historic bequest - capital invested and growth tagged to purchase/care for collection


items

  - Burton Fund – historic bequest, capital invested and growth tagged to purchase collection items

  - Acquisitions Fund [predominantly Legacy Group funds] and Fields Pond – specific funds sought and held in


trust to purchase collection items, put the collection on-line, provide educative interpretation and our art

library.

  - Education Endowment Fund- Donated funds invested and tagged for educational purposes.

  - Large-scale Asset Renewal Fund - a fund established to provide for asset maintenance and renewal. It is


guided by our 25-year Long-Term Maintenance Plan (LTMP); This was commissioned by the Trust on

completion of the Redevelopment Project and established from the balance of funds remaining after said

project. The LTMP informs planning, funding and decisions to ensure the premises and related plant and

equipment are properly maintained, fit for purpose and consistent with the provisions of the _“Addendum_

_to Heads of Agreement between NCC and the BST for the Redevelopment of the Bishop Suter Art Gallery_

_signed 2 July 2014”._


- **Total Exchange Revenue** is budgeted to increase by 1.4% to $506,009 – from a forecast of $498,847 for the


current 22/23 financial year. This will be derived from increases in our overall commercial activity, especially

retail which continues to go from strength to strength.

- **Total Non-Exchange Revenue** – is budgeted to increase by 8% to $1,057,550 due to specific fundraising events


and growing partner sponsorships. The NCC grant has been increased by 3.5%.


~~•~~ **Total Expenses** are adjusted to $1,969,828, up 4.3% from the forecast for 22/23 year. The following are the

details as a comparison to the 22/23 year:


~~•~~
Personnel costs are up 8.2% to $684,547 - within this is a general increase to living wage & salaries.

~~•~~ Administration costs are up 18.5% due to the increase in insurance costs; these are forecast to increase

by up to 20%.

~~•~~ Visitor Services costs are up due to the increased costs associated with additional fundraising activities

planned for the 2023/24 year.

~~•~~
Maintenance costs are budgeted to decrease by 22% down to $68,794; by comparison, the 22/23 year

will incur $30,000 in the 8 yearly exterior painting of the Old Gallery

   - Repairs and maintenance [R&M] costs for the building are now increasing significantly now we are over 6
years old. At this stage it appears that on analysis of the LTMP these percentages will continue to
increase. Note: the following percentages do not include facility or capital costs:

-R&M costs as a percentage of revenue are as follows: 2020 @ 0.8%; 2021 @ 1.23%; 2022 @
1.7%; 2023 @ 5.7%; 2024 @ 4.1%.


P a g e | **22**


~~•~~ Property and Personnel costs remain our largest expenditure areas; with power and insurance our two

largest single invoice costs. We are working proactively and with specific project teams on these two cost

areas to attempt to mitigate increases where possible.

  - **Investment Interest Income** has been kept conservative given the level of change in the investment


market.

  - **Cash Operating Surplus**


Please note on page 24 the insertion of “Calculation of Cash Operating Surplus (pink section). The data is

as follows for 2024 Budget year:


`o` **Cash Operating Surplus +$270,274**

`o` Initial Cash Operating Surplus/Deficits +$103,477

`o` Plus draw down from NCC held depreciation fund of $66,200 _(estimate only at this stage)_

`o` Plus draw down from The Suter’s Large-scale Asset Renewal Fund (invested) of $100,597 (The


Suter’s annual 50% share of the LTMP and capital purposes)


**Note** :

The amount estimated for the 2023 year is:

**Cash Operating Surplus is +$214,715**

Initial Cash Operating Surplus/Deficits +$97,471

Plus draw down from NCC held depreciation fund of $57,324

Plus draw down from The Suter’s Large-scale Asset Renewal Fund (invested) of $5,920 (The Suter’s annual

50% share of the LTMP and capital purposes)


_*$57,324 draw down from the NCC depreciation fund is calculated from $41,434 already drawn down from NCC_
_and paid to The Suter (we applied in relation to the financial year 2021/22, but allocated the paid funds in the_
_current 2023 year); and $15,889_ _**estimated**_ _as NCC’s 50% share of capital costs & large-scale maintenance as_
_forecast in the current 2023 year._

##### **Appendix II: The Bishop Suter Trust Statement of Accounting Policies**

**Statement of significant accounting policies**


**i.** **REPORTING ENTITY**

The Bishop Suter Trust (the Trust) is a charitable trust incorporated in New Zealand under the
Charitable Trusts Act 2005 on 5 April 2008 and is domiciled in New Zealand. The Trust is
controlled by Nelson City Council as a Council Controlled Organisation as defined under section 6
of the Local Government Act 2002, by virtue of the Council’s right to appoint the Board of

Trustees

The primary objective of the Trust is to provide the people of Nelson and visitors to the region
access to our cultural heritage and to the many forms of contemporary cultural expression. This
means communicating the diverse ideas and experiences that art offers to the widest possible
audience by the presentation of quality visual arts programmes and by developing and caring for
the permanent collection.

Accordingly, the Trust has designated itself as a public benefit entity for the purposes of New
Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS).


**ii.** **BASIS OF PREPARATION**

**Compliance**
The financial statements of the Trust will be prepared in accordance with the requirements of
the Local Government Act 2002, which includes the requirement to comply with New Zealand
generally accepted accounting practice (NZ GAAP).

Financial statements will be prepared in accordance with NZ GAAP and comply with NZ IFRS, and
other applicable Financial Reporting Standards, as appropriate for public benefit entities.

**Measurement base**

The financial statements will be prepared on a historical cost basis.

**Functional and presentation currency**
The financial statements will be presented in New Zealand dollars and all values rounded to the
nearest dollar. The functional currency of the Trust is New Zealand dollars.

**Changes in accounting policies**
No changes in accounting policies are anticipated. In the event there are, they will be disclosed.


**iii.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Revenue**

Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received.

**Grants**

Grants received from Nelson City Council and Tasman District Council are the primary sources of
funding to the Trust and are restricted for the purposes of the Trust meeting its objectives as
specified in the Trust’s Trust Deed. The Trust also receives grants from other entities, and these
grants have restrictions on their use.

Council, government and non-government grants are recognized as revenue when they become
receivable unless there is an obligation to return the funds if conditions of the grant are not met.


P a g e | **28**



If there is such an obligation, the grants are initially recorded as grants received in advance and
recognised as revenue when conditions of the grant are satisfied.

**Other revenue**

Products held for sale are recognized when a product is sold to the customer.

Where art works are donated in the Trust for nil consideration, the fair value of the work is
recognised as income.

Interest income is recognised on receipt.

Volunteer services received are not recognised as revenue or expenditure as the Trust is unable
to reliably measure the fair value of the services received.

**Advertising costs**
Advertising costs are expensed when the related service has been rendered.

**Borrowing costs**
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

**Income Tax**

The Trust has been granted Charitable status by the Inland Revenue Department, and therefore
is exempt from income tax.

**Leases**


  - Finance Leases

The Trust has no finance leases.


  - Operating leases
The Trust has 3 (tenancy) leases with other parties; these leases cover the Trust’s Theatre, the
Café and a special lease arrangement with NSAS. The income received from the leases is
recorded as income on receipt. The Trust also has an operating lease for its photocopier.

There are no incentives attached to the leases.

**Cash and cash equivalents**
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short
term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less.

**Debtors and other receivables**

Debtors and other receivables are usually paid within a month. Other than operational grants,
debtors are not significant.

**Inventories**

Inventories are held at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Any Trust published inventory
remaining after 2 years is written off.

**Investments**

Investments are shown at actual or realisable value.

**Property, plant and equipment**


P a g e | **29**



Land and buildings were re-valued for the Trust’s opening balance. Plant and equipment were
brought on at book value, i.e. cost less accumulated depreciation.

**Additions**

The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if, and only if, it is
probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to
the Trust and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

In most instances, an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost. When an asset
is acquired at no cost, or for a nominal cost, it is recognised at fair value when control over the

asset is obtained.

**Disposals**
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying
amount of the asset. Gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the statement of financial
performance.

**Subsequent costs**
Costs incurred subsequent to initial acquisition are capitalised only when it is probable that
future economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the Trust and
the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

**Depreciation**
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis on all property plant and equipment at rates that

will write-off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values over their useful lives. The

useful lives and associated depreciation rates of major classes of assets have been estimated as

follows:

Buildings 50 years (2%)
Improvements 20 years (5%)
Furniture and fittings 16 years (6.25%)
Computer equipment 5 years (20%)

The residual value and useful life of an asset is reviewed, and adjusted if applicable, at each
financial year end.

**Intangible assets**
Software acquisition:
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire
and bring to use the specific software.

Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense when

incurred.

Costs associated with the development and maintenance of the Trust’s website are recognised as
an expense when incurred because the website is primarily promoting the Trust’s services.

Staff training costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.

**Amortisation**

Computer software licences are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life
of 5 years. Amortisation begins when the asset is available for use and ceases at the date that the


P a g e | **30**



asset is disposed of. The amortisation charge for each period is recognised in the Statement of

Financial Position.

**Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets**
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment at each balance date. When
impairment is recognised, the recoverable value of the asset is estimated, an impairment loss is
recognised and the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.

Impairment loss is recognised in the statement of financial performance.

**Collection**

The opening balance of the Collection is the deemed cost at market valuation at the
commencement of the Trust. Items purchased for the Collection are recorded at cost. Items
donated to the Collection are valued at the time of acquisition and recorded at valuation.

The value of the Collection assets is reviewed and reassessed from time to time.

In accordance with IFRS, the Trust will apply an impairment test to the Collection each year.
The Collection is not depreciated.

**Creditors and other payables**
Creditors and other payables are measured at fair value.

**Employee entitlements**

Short term entitlements

Entitlements that the Trust expects to be settled within 12 months of balance date are measured
at nominal values based on accrued entitlements at current rates of pay.

These include annual leave and holiday pay earned to, but not yet taken at balance date.

**Good and Service Tax (GST)**
All items on the financial statements are stated exclusive of GST, except for receivables and
payables, which are stated on a GST inclusive basis. Where GST is not recoverable as input tax
then it is recognized as part of the related asset or expense.

The net GST recoverable from or payable to, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) is included as
part of the receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.

The net GST paid to or received from the IRD, including the GST relating to investing and
financing activities, is classified as an operating cash flow in the statement of cash flows.

**Budget figures**
The budget figures are those approved by the Trustees at the beginning of the year in the
Statement of Intent. This budget has also been reassessed post Covid to reflect the expected
global downturn and reduced tourism numbers over the next year.
The budget figures have been prepared in accordance with NZ IFRS, using accounting policies
that are consistent with those adopted by the Trust for the preparation of the financial

statements.

**Critical accounting estimates and assumptions**
The Trust has made a number of estimates and assumptions in the preparations of the financial

forecasts.


P a g e | **31**




    - That Council funding will be consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding and
Community Plans

    - A consistent level of donations has been assumed

    - Commercial revenue is based on visitor numbers and historical performance

    - Expenditure costs have both an historical and an actual (if known) base

**Critical judgement in applying the Trust’s accounting policies**
The Trustees must exercise their judgement when recognising grant income to determine if
conditions of the grant contract have been satisfied. This judgement will be based on the facts
and circumstances that are evident for each grant contract.

##### **Appendix III: The Trust’s Approach to Governance**


**Governance Principles**


The Trust operates to the Principles and Guidelines for Corporate Governance in New Zealand, published by the
Securities Commission New Zealand;


- Trustees should observe and foster high ethical standards.


- There should be a balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience, and perspectives among
Trustees so that the Board works effectively.


- The Board should use committees where this would enhance its effectiveness in key areas while retaining
board responsibility.


- The Board should demand integrity both in financial reporting and in the timeliness and balance of
disclosures on entity affairs.


- The remuneration of Trustees and executives should be transparent, fair, and reasonable.


- The Board should regularly verify that the entity has appropriate processes that identify and manage
potential and relevant risks.


- The Board should ensure the quality and independence of the external audit process.


- The Board should foster constructive relationships with NCC that encourage them to engage with the
entity.


- The Board should respect the interests of stakeholders within the context of the entity’s ownership type
and its fundamental purpose.


**The Role of The Trust Board**


- Ensuring that the Trust operates in accordance with its Deed of Trust.


- Ensuring that the Trust meets its objectives as defined in this Statement of Intent.


- Ensuring the Trust complies with all its lawful obligations.


- Ensuring the NCC are kept well informed on all relevant issues and that there are “no surprises” on
matters likely to cause community or political concern.


- Making any decisions as to policy that are not the preserve of general management and day-to-day

administration.


- Employing the Gallery Director (including entering into a performance management agreement,
reviewing performance and setting remuneration).


- Ensuring sound financial management of The Trust.


**Composition of The Board**


- The Board is made up of 6 non-executive Trustees.


P a g e | **33**


- Trustees are appointed by resolution of Council in accordance with the Trust Deed of The Bishop Suter
Trust, the Council’s policy for the appointment of Trustees and cognisant of the balance of competencies
that shall include financial stewardship, expertise and knowledge in art matters and issues, education,
tourism, regional development, promotion, iwi perspectives and cultural awareness [15] .


  - Ideally the BST should have a split of members who have business, marketing, human resources, legal
and financial skills and those who have significant understanding of art, fundraising skills and networks,
both local and national including in terms of patronage.


- The Trustees appoint a Chairperson at the first meeting after the AGM.


**Board Remuneration**


- The NCC will set total remuneration for the Board. The Board will from time to time determine their

remuneration and apportionment of this allocation cognisant of The Trust’s financial position.


**Risk Management Policies**


- The Board shall ensure that appropriate insurance is maintained on all insurable risks of the Trust, and in
particular public liability insurance and insurance of the heritage assets.


- The Board shall ensure that the Trust has procedures in place to achieve compliance with all applicable
legislation.


- The Board will complete a risk review annually and identify mitigations of those risks. Cyber security and
environment risks form part of the evaluation


- The Chair of the Audit & Risk Sub-committee also sits on the Executive Health & Safety Committee as a
Board representative. Minutes of meetings are distributed to all Trustees


- The Board has a 25-year property maintenance & renewal plan (LTMP).


**Guidance and Resources Provided to Board Members.**


Sound financial management and systems that provide reports to the Board as follows:


- Statement of financial performance for the preceding month, year to date and year end projections.


- Statement of financial position at the preceding month end.


- Statement of cash flow for the preceding month and monthly update on expected year end position.


- Gallery Director’s report addressing issues related to the Trust’s performance against objectives (financial
and non-financial).


- The Board will ensure that relevant training opportunities are made available to Trustees.

P a g e | **34**


**Board and management Succession Planning**


- With a small staff it is not possible to have succession planning for all key positions e.g., Director, Curator,
Educator or Manager Commerce and Enterprise as there are limited opportunities for internal
promotion.


- Trustee succession relies on identification of competency needs prior to trustee rotation/replacement;
and ensuring that there is cover during Trustee change (which may involve short duration extension of
term(s) to provide transition support to an incoming trustee(s)).


- The Board is considering trustee mentorships to introduce diversity into Board committees, and for the

Board itself.


**Board Performance Review**


- A performance review is undertaken every 18 months. Initiatives arising from this include:


-the need to focus on a Board succession programme; review of subcommittees and their Terms of

Reference
