unless that person has first obtained the Council’s written permission.


25.4 A person may apply to the Council for permission to construct, alter, repair, or remove
a vehicle crossing, if that person has some interest in the land to which the vehicle
crossing will provide access. The application must be in writing, be accompanied by
the prescribed fee, and indicate which Council approved contractor will carry out the
work.


25.5 The Council may grant permission to construct, alter, repair, or remove a vehicle
crossing, and in doing so may impose any conditions it considers appropriate,
including requiring that the work comply with any applicable Council code of practice
and that it be carried out by a Council approved contractor.


25.6 Granting permission under clause 25.5 does not give the applicant any authority over
the use of the footpath or berm over which the vehicle crossing passes.


25.7 The Council may, by written notice, require an owner of land to which a vehicle
crossing provides access to upgrade the vehicle crossing where it is satisfied that:


(a) the vehicle crossing is in a poor state of repair so that it creates a risk of
damage to the road, or to road users; or


(b) there has been a substantial change in the use of the vehicle crossing (for
instance, it is now regularly used by heavy motor vehicles) so as to warrant
an upgrade.


25.8 A written notice under clause 25.7 must:


(a) set out the upgrade work that is required;


(b) reference any Council codes of practice that the work must comply with; and


(c) specify a time period in which the works must be completed.


25.9 An owner who receives a notice from the Council under clause 25.7 must comply with
the notice within the specified period, and meet all associated costs.


25.10 The Council may remove a vehicle crossing (and reinstate the footpath or berm) in
the event that the owner of land to which the vehicle crossing provides access has
abandoned the vehicle crossing (for instance, if the owner constructs a fence across
the driveway served by the vehicle crossing) or it is otherwise unlikely to continue to
be used on a regular basis.


25.11 Before exercising the power in clause 25.10, the Council must use reasonable
endeavours to consult with the affected owner.

any);


(g) any class of vehicles (including vehicles displaying an authorised vehicle
permit issued by the Council) that are exempt from the payment of fees and
charges in the payment parking zone; and


(h) any condition the Council considers necessary or desirable for the efficient
management and control of all or any part of the payment parking zone.

leaves a parking space within that zone, but within 30 minutes of doing so either:

prescribed under clause 34.2(b) starts again from the time that the vehicle is reparked, and any first hour free or other similar resolutions made by the Council under
this clause do not apply.


34.5 The fees and charges set for a payment parking zone under clause 34.2(c) will not
apply to any parking space (or other area in a road or parking place) in the payment
parking zone that has been reserved by the Council for a particular class of vehicle

34.6 Any part of a payment parking zone can concurrently also be part of a time restricted
parking zone.


34.7 A person must not:


(a) park a vehicle in a payment parking zone without paying all applicable fees

35.1 The Council may by resolution declare any road (or group of roads) or parking place
to be a taxi restricted parking zone.

Transport Rule: Operator Licensing 2017.


**36.** **Parking in parking spaces**


36.1 When parking in a parking space, a person must –

(as the case may be) is as near as is practical to the kerb or footpath (or as
near as wheel stops permit) but does not overhang the kerb or footpath.


36.2 Despite clause 36.1, a person may park an oversize vehicle or a vehicle that has a
trailer attached in two adjacent parking spaces that are in the same alignment,
provided it does not overhang any kerb or footpath.


36.3 Despite clause 36.1, a person parking a motorcycle or moped may –


(a) park in a parking space that is already occupied by another motorcycle or
moped (in which case, the driver of each motorcycle or moped is required to

enable them to carry out maintenance or construction work on a network utility
operator’s assets.


**38.** **Repairs on vehicles**


38.1 A person must not carry out repairs or modifications to a vehicle on a road unless

**39.** **Broken down vehicles**

40.1 This clause 40 applies to items such as machinery, equipment, materials, portaloos,
skips, waste receptacles or freight containers, but does not apply to other items that

collection that are placed no more than 24 hours prior to the collection day and left
no longer than 12 hours after scheduled collection time).


40.2 A person must not leave any item on any road unless that person has the prior written
permission of an Authorised Officer.


40.3 Where an item is on a road pursuant to a written permission from an Authorised
Officer, and the area of road is a parking place to which a parking fee or charge applies,
the person who placed the item must pay the required fee for the entire time period
that the item is in place.


40.4 If an item is placed contrary to the requirements of clause 40.1, 40.2, or 40.3 (including
if placement does not comply with the conditions of a written permission from an
Authorised Officer) –


(a) the Council may request the person responsible for the item remove it and
repair any damage to the road caused by the item, to the Council’s
satisfaction, within 24 hours of receiving a written notice to that effect from
an Authorised Officer (or within any longer timeframe set by the Authorised
Officer in the notice); and


(b) in the event the person responsible for the item fails to fully comply with the
written notice from an Authorised Officer, the Council may –
