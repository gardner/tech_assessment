## **introduction**

#### **DI1 Why a Design Guide?**

The Council, in the development of the Nelson Resource Management Plan (the
Plan), has identified particular residential areas which it considers merit
protection as Heritage Precincts.


The Heritage Precinct recognises that the whole is greater than the sum of the
parts; that a collection of Heritage Buildings, in context, has a greater impact on
the observer and the resident, and has greater heritage value than the same
number of buildings scattered throughout the city. The loss or the
unsympathetic alteration to even a single building detracts from the whole
Precinct rather like a missing tooth from a smile.


An important role of the Guidelines will be educational - to raise the awareness
of the residents and possible developers of the special nature of this Precinct, and
the impact on the street of alterations undertaken on a single building.


The Guide shall ensure that alterations to existing buildings, and new buildings
in the Precinct, are sensitive and enhance the existing visual qualities of the

streetscape.

#### **DI2 General Objectives of the Design Guidelines**


a) To identify the essential heritage values of each Precinct.


b) To set out ways in which these values can be protected and enhanced.


c) To provide education and information for building owners contemplating
changes to their property.


d) To help develop city-wide recognition of the value of these areas to the
Nelson community.

#### **DI3 How the Design Guidelines Operate**


The Design Guidelines operate on three levels:


i) They give a simple description of the history, the visual characteristics and
the special nature of the Precinct, thereby promoting residents’ and the
public’s awareness of, and sensitivity to, our heritage contained within the

Precinct.


ii) Owners and designers will find them a useful reference for preparing
sympathetic designs for new buildings or building alterations.


iii) In reviewing development proposals the Nelson City Council will use the
Design Guidelines as a measure of how well the intended design fits the
objectives and policies of the Nelson Resource Management Plan.


Buildings within the Precinct will need to meet the requirements of the Plan.


**2** **Nelson City Council** **Dear Cottages**
**August 2023** **Design Guide**


Note in particular the rules in Chapter 7 relating to Heritage Precincts and the
demolition or removal of houses.


The Design Guidelines deal with three different situations:


a) new buildings, including houses;


b) alterations and additions to non-listed buildings; and


c) alterations and additions to listed Heritage Buildings. (ie. heritage
buildings listed in the Plan, Appendix 1).


The Guidelines are concerned primarily with the streetscape and the appearance
of the buildings from the street.


The street elevation is obviously part of the streetscape, however the significance
of the side walls and roof to the streetscape depend on such issues as the distance
between houses and the height of a house in relation to its neighbours. This will
be assessed by Council staff on an individual basis. Interior alterations or
additions at the rear, or private areas of dwellings, which cannot be seen from
the street are not covered by the Guidelines.

#### **DI4 Area covered by the Design Guidelines**


A map showing the extent of the Precinct is attached at the end of the
Performance Guidelines, along with a table which identifies the listed Heritage
Buildings.


All houses in the Dear Cottages Heritage Precinct are listed Heritage Buildings.

## **guidelines –** **dear cottages** **precinct**

#### **DC1 Historical Context**

The six cottages located at the top end of Rutherford Street were built 1886-87.
Five cottages are of timber construction while the sixth is constructed of brick.
They were built by William Dear who built several other houses in the area.


Over the years verandahs have been added to some cottages and windows have
been altered, but the character has been retained and as a group they are an
important part of Nelson’s history.


Several of the houses have been well restored by their owners.


The cottages have been rated very highly in the list of Heritage Buildings in the
Nelson Resource Management Plan, and are listed as Category II with Heritage
New Zealand.

#### **DC2 Objectives**


The key design objectives within the Dear Cottages Precinct are:


a) to maintain the six cottages and encourage the restoration of the street
frontages


b) to ensure that future development of the corner shop be sympathetic to
the cottages so that the character of the street is enhanced, and


c) to ensure that where an existing cottage has to be replaced the new house
is built in a style to replicate the existing cottage.

#### **DC3 Visual Characteristics**


DC3.1 Height


The cottages are single storey.


DC3.2 Closeness to the Street and Side Boundaries


The cottages are close to the street and form a strong coherent group. The side
yards are minimal.


**4** **Nelson City Council** **Dear Cottages**
**August 2023** **Design Guide**


DC3.3 Parking


No on site parking is possible because of the proximity of the cottages to the
street and side boundaries.


DC3.4 Fencing


The relationship of the cottages to the street depends on the openness of the
houses to the street. The low wooden picket fence is ideal for this purpose,
gently defining the boundary, but maintaining openness.


High fences are inappropriate.


DC3.5 Verandahs


The original cottages did not have verandahs. However, they have been added
to several cottages very successfully, and seem an appropriate addition.


DC3.6 Materials and Detailing


The five timber framed cottages are clad in rusticated weatherboard with
corrugated roofing. The sixth cottage is of brick construction. The original
materials are a very important part of the heritage values of the houses and they
should be maintained.


DC3.7 Windows and Doors


The street elevations are very simple with well
proportioned timber windows and doors.


Inappropriate replacement windows can destroy the
elevation.

#### **DC4 Performance Guidelines**


DC4.1 Listed Heritage Buildings


The listed Heritage Buildings are important elements in the Precinct. They shall
be retained and their values preserved, and:


a) demolition or removal of group A and B buildings requires a resource
consent under the Nelson Resource Management Plan;


b) additions or alterations which impact on the streetscape shall continue the
use of timber weatherboards, corrugated roofing, timber joinery and
detailing all to match the original. Windows should match the original in
shape, size and proportion;


c) the addition of a verandah with appropriate detail is to be encouraged; and


d) the single storey nature of the cottages and roof shapes shall be
maintained.


DC4.2 Corner Shop - 228 Rutherford Street


Arriving down Waimea Road, this building is an important part of the Precinct.
Alterations to the existing building or a new development shall be designed to
enhance and complement the cottages, and shall:


a) maintain the single storey nature of the cottages with roofline matching


**Dear Cottages** **Nelson City Council** **5**
**Design Guide** **August 2023**


the existing height and pitches;


b) be designed in such a way that it enhances the Precinct and uses materials
that complement the cottages; and


c) provide verandahs similar to the cottages.


DC4.3 New Buildings


a) shall be designed to replicate the appearance of the existing cottages from
the street using the same materials;


b) the existing line of cottages on the street frontage shall be maintained; and


c) the single storey nature of the cottages and roof shapes shall be maintained.


DC4.4 Garages


Garages are not permitted in the front yard. Garages in the side yards shall be
designed to match the existing house in form, details and use of materials.


DC4.5 Fences


New fences on street frontage shall be timber picket fences, and a maximum of
900mm in height from footpath level.

## **planning** **applications**

#### **PA1 Application of the Nelson Resource Management** **Plan**

The following activities are permitted (no resource consent is required):


Interior alterations to any building within the Heritage Precinct (unless
otherwise specified in Appendix 1 Heritage Buildings, Places and Objects).


Exterior alterations to any part of a building within the Heritage Precinct visible
from an adjoining street or public place, if:


a) the work is redecoration, restoration or insignificant alteration of any
existing fabric or detailing; and
b) it is carried out to the same scale as the original, including window scale,
and with materials and details similar to, or having the same appearance
to those originally used.


The following activities require a resource consent application:


a) all new buildings, and
b) exterior alterations to any part of an existing building within the Heritage
Precinct which are visible from an adjoining street or public space, if the
work is not a permitted activity according to the definition above.


The consent application will be a Restricted Discretionary Activity. Such
applications will be non-notified ie. considered without notification.


The Council’s assessment of the application will be based on:


i) compliance with the Design Guide for the Precinct.
ii) any effects (both positive and adverse) on the heritage values of the entire
Heritage Precinct.
iii) any cumulative or precedent effects on the values of the Precinct.


Note that a resource consent application is also required for the removal of an
unreinforced masonry chimney, a customer connection from a network utility,
or a sustainability addition, where permitted standards are not met (refer to the
Heritage Precinct rules in Chapter 7 of the Plan). A resource consent application
is also required for any proposal to demolish or remove a house within the
Precinct (see PA3 below).

#### **PA2 Consultation**


Early consultation with the Nelson City Council Planning Department is
encouraged to resolve design issues prior to lodging a resource consent
application. Consultation should begin at the commencement of design.

#### **PA3 Demolition or removal of Buildings**

The Nelson Resource Management Plan should be consulted if demolition or
removal of any house in the Precinct is contemplated, whether or not it is a listed
Heritage Building.


Any application for consent to demolish or remove must satisfy the tests in the
Plan. In addition, any demolition or removal application must be accompanied
by a resource consent application for the intended replacement building.

#### **PA4 Supporting information required**


Resource consent applications for any building development shall include:


a) the street elevation of the building, extended to show the elevations of the
buildings on either side.
b) a written analysis of the manner in which the proposed development
responds to the Design Guide and how it relates to the heritage values of
the Precinct.
