### **Proposed Plan Changes**

The following table provides a complete list of all proposed Plan Changes that affect the Nelson
Resource Management Plan.


Proposed Plan Changes are indicated in the Nelson Resource Management Plan in one of two ways,
either


1. by strikethrough or underline text (method currently being phased out), or


2. with a black octagon symbol showing the Plan Change number placed as near as practical to
the title of the provision subject to change.


For full details of a proposed Plan Change and its current progress through the First Schedule RMA
[process please refer to Nelson City Council website: www.nelsoncitycouncil.co.nz](http://www.nelsoncitycouncil.co.nz/) (use plan change
name as search phrase).


**Nelson Resource Management Plan: Proposed Plan Changes**


**Plan Change** **Type** **Summary** **Notified**







**Nelson Resource Management Plan - Proposed Changes (31/08/2015)** **PC-i**


**DO18.1.1.ii** A minimum flow does not mean that flows will not sometimes
naturally fall below this level. The minimum flow reflects the probability of a flow
reaching that level, whether that is on average once a year (mean annual low flow) or
once over a five year period. The aim is to avoid taking water out of these waterways
during these very low flows to avoid causing extra stress for instream life. Minimum
flow levels vary depending upon the management objectives established for each water
body. These objectives are listed in the table in Appendix 28.2.
**DO18.1.1.iii** Trigger flows have also been set. When flow levels drop to this
level, all non-essential abstraction from that river are suspended, except where an
approved ‘Water Conservation Plan’ exists.
**DO18.1.1.iv** Wai (water) will be the starting point for the development of Iwi
environmental indicators, using the Maitahi (Maitai) River as a case study.  The
literature review recently carried out as part of the Council initiated study of the Maitai
will provide a resource for the Iwi indicators project.

**policy**
**DO18.1.2** **flow regimes: other rivers and streams**
_**Manage water flows and levels in other rivers and streams not specified in**_
_**Appendix 28.2 through allocation limits on resource consents.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO18.1.2.i** Minimum flow regimes or trigger flows have not been established
for rivers and streams not specified in Appendix 28.2. Many of these water bodies are
located in the Conservation Zone or in rural areas and contain high quality water and
significant ecological communities. In addition, these rivers and streams are generally
not under any pressure from water users, and are unlikely to be subject to abstraction
in the future.


**Methods (for policies DO18.1.1 and DO18.1.2)**


**DO18.1.2.ii** Rules controlling water takes during periods of low flow.
**DO18.1.2.iii** Assessment matters for resource consent applications.
**DO18.1.2.iv** Monitoring of flow levels.
**DO18.1.2.v** Timely information to water users about current flow levels and
options when low flow conditions occur.
**DO18.1.2.vi** Increase awareness of rural areas where water shortages are likely
to occur.

**policy**
**DO18.1.3** **increased demands for water**

_**Address increased demand for water created by population growth.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO18.1.3.i** This policy recognises that the population for the Nelson City Council area
is expected to increase by 24% from 2001 to 2021. This has significant implications
regarding increasing demand for out-of-stream uses of water.
**DO18.1.3.ii** Increased demand for water in both the urban and rural zones means that a
number of measures will be necessary to avoid the cumulative effects of that
population growth on water resources.
**DO18.1.3.iii** The Council recognises that as the city grows there will be an
increased demand for water from the Maitai and Roding rivers. While the Council will
be able to continue to meet the minimum flows established in the urban supply
resource consent, the opportunities to leave more water in the Maitai and Roding rivers
will reduce as urban water supply demands increase. For this reason, and in recognition
that water is a precious resource, the Council will promote efficient use of water,
rainwater storage, and water reuse.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/11/12)** **5- 97**


**Methods**


**DO18.1.3.iv** Actively monitor water permits and instream flows, to ensure that:
a) consent conditions are adhered to, and
b) sufficient residual flows remain to provide for in-stream values, and
c) water is returned to the source where it is no longer needed for abstraction, and
d) accurate information is held on what water permits are held but not used,
particularly for over-allocated rivers.
**DO18.1.3.v** Meter all consented water takes.
**DO18. 1.3.vi** Continue to monitor river flows and set up new monitoring sites,
where necessary, to improve data flow.
**DO18. 1.3.vii** Set up a website to advise users of flow levels.
**DO18. 1.3.viii** Limit most water permits to 10 years to allow for regular review of
allocations.
**DO18.1.3.ix** Change the conditions on existing water permits which do not meet
allocation limits specified in Appendix 28.2 (refer to Policy DO18.3.1(b)).
**DO18.1.3.x** Require rainwater storage for new residential units in rural areas.
**DO18.1.3.xi** Promote efficient use of water, rainwater storage, and water reuse
in the urban area.
**DO18.1.3.xii** State of the environment monitoring and reporting.

**policy**
**DO18.1.4** **water quantity** **(NPS – Freshwater Management 2014)**
_**1. When considering an application for a discharge, the consent authority must**_
_**have regard to the following matters:**_
_**(a)**_ _**The extent to which the change would adversely affect safeguarding the life-**_
_**supporting capacity of freshwater and of any associated ecosystem and**_
_**(b)**_ _**The extent to which it is feasible and dependable that any adverse effect on**_
_**the life supporting capacity of freshwater and of any associated ecosystem**_
_**resulting from the change would be avoided.**_
_**2. This policy applies to:**_
_**(a)**_ _**Any new activity and**_
_**(b)**_ _**Any change in the character, intensity of scale of any established activity –**_
_**that involves any taking, using, damming or diverting of fresh water or**_
_**draining of any wetland which is likely to result in any more than minor**_
_**adverse change in the natural variability of flows or level of any fresh water,**_
_**compared to that which immediately preceded the commencement of the new**_
_**activity of the change in the established activity (or in the case of a change in**_
_**an intermittent or seasonal activity, compared to that on the last occasion on**_
_**which the activity was carried out).**_
_**3. This policy does not apply to any application for consent first lodged before the**_
_**National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management 2011 took effect on 1 July**_
_**2011.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO18.1.4.i** This policy has been included (under section 55 RMA) as directed by the
National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management 2014.

#### **objective** **DO18.2 underground flows and levels**


_**Water levels and flows within the region’s groundwater sufficient to maintain a range of uses and**_
_**sustain underground aquatic life, and groundwater levels and flows are enhanced where uses and**_
_**values have been degraded as a result of modified levels or flows.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO18.2.i** In Nelson there are a small number of groundwater takes for a variety of
uses. Groundwater abstractions need to occur in a way which does not adversely affect
flow levels in aquifers and associated surface water.


**5-98** **(31/08/15) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


**policy**
**DO18.2.1** **managing underground abstractions**
_**The effects of underground abstractions on aquifer levels and on surface flows**_
_**and levels will be considered on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the**_
_**precautionary principle.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO18.2.1.i** The potential effects of groundwater abstractions need to be
carefully assessed due to the lack of information on groundwater resources. The link
between groundwater and surface flow, including wetlands, should be given particular
consideration. Where the outcome of a proposed groundwater take is unknown or there
is insufficient information to enable a reasonable assessment, abstraction should be
avoided.
**DO18.2.1.ii** Unless there is information to the contrary, groundwater takes
adjacent to rivers listed in Appendix 28.4 will be taken as having a one to one effect on
river flows, for the purposes of water allocation and implementing water restrictions.


**Methods**


**DO18.2.1.iii** Rules controlling quantity of water taken for domestic uses in the
rural area.
**DO8.2.1.iv** Rules controlling installation and decommissioning of bores and
wells.

#### **objective** **DO18.3 providing for water abstraction**


_**Provided that objectives DO18.1 and DO18.2 can be met, allocate water for abstraction in a way**_
_**which:**_


_**•**_ _**provides a reliable supply under normal flow conditions, and**_

_**•**_ _**is equitably distributed between all water users while taking into account the priority**_
_**uses of fire fighting, reasonable domestic use (including reticulated urban domestic**_
_**use), and reasonable stock water use, and**_

_**•**_ _**provides for and promotes efficiency in water use.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO18.3.i** This objective recognises that abstraction of water is a value in
itself. While provision needs to be made for water allocation, including permitted
abstractions, this needs to be balanced against the long term life supporting capacity of
water and the associated ecosystems. Efficient water use is particularly important in
Nelson, where the small size of the rivers and streams means that abstraction has the
potential for a proportionally greater effect on the overall river or stream values.

**policy**
**DO18.3.1** **water permits**
_**Implement a water permit system for any water take based on the following**_
_**criteria:**_
_**a) Single-class permit system for all rivers and streams.**_
_**b) All existing water permits which do not meet any new flows, levels, or**_
_**allocation limits specified in the Plan will be required to meet 80% of the new**_
_**flows, levels, or allocation limits within 2 years of the freshwater plan change**_
_**becoming operative, and fully comply within 5 years of the freshwater plan**_
_**change becoming operative.**_
_**c) All applications for water permits, including renewals of existing permits, will**_
_**be treated as new applications and assessed on a case by case basis. Physical**_
_**resources relating to a previous water permit are an assessment matter which**_
_**can be considered as part of the application process. The RMA Amendment Act**_
_**2005 requires the efficiency of the applicant’s use of the resource to be**_
_**considered when determining applications from existing water permit holders.**_
_**d) Consider declining an application to take water where taking from an**_
_**alternative water source on the applicant’s property or through an**_


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (31/08/15)** **5- 99**


_**alternative available supply is likely to have less adverse effect on the**_
_**water resource, or result in more equitable water allocation.**_
_**e) review water permits and allocation limits where:**_
_**i)**_ _**the water is surplus to the actual annual water requirements of the existing**_
_**activity (at a 1 in 5 year low flow), or**_
_**ii) the activity has changed such that the full allocation is no longer required, or**_
_**iii) flow records show the water resource available for allocation is less than**_
_**originally thought.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO18.3.1.i** Under a single class water permit system all permits have equal
security of water supply. Policy D018.3.5 (allocation limits for specified rivers)
specifies how existing water permits are dealt with during periods of low flow.
**DO18.3.1.ii** “Existing water permits” includes any permit to dam or divert
water as well as takes and uses, and includes every permit which was lawfully
established and in use at 9 October 2004 (the notification of these Freshwater Plan
Change).
**DO18.3.1.iii** In order to achieve sustainable flow levels in all water bodies it is
necessary to review all existing water permit allocations and to reduce the effect of
those allocations where they do not meet the new standards for minimum flows.
**DO18.3.1.iv** This policy is inserted in accordance with sections 68(7) and 128 of
the Resource Management Act which states that:
a) where a regional plan includes a rule relating to maximum or minimum levels of
flows or rates of use of water, the plan may state whether the rule shall affect the
exercise of existing resource consents for activities which contravene the rule and that
the holders of resource consents may comply with the terms of the rule, or rules, in
stages over specified periods, and
b) in order to enable minimum flow levels set in an operative regional water plan to be
met, a consent authority may serve notice of its intention to review the conditions on a
resource consent. However, changes made to a consent in accordance with section 128
cannot render a consent inoperable.

**policy**
**DO18.3.2** **monitoring water abstraction**
_**Monitor new and existing water abstraction to improve knowledge of total water**_
_**takes and manage the allocation of water so that the cumulative effects of water**_
_**abstraction do not exceed:**_
_**i)**_ _**any flow regimes, or**_
_**ii)**_ _**any allocation limit for a water body, or**_
_**iii)**_ _**the sustainable yield of an aquifer.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO18.3.2.i** In order to comply with the conditions of water allocation, water
users need to know how much water they are actually taking. Monitoring water takes
through water meters provides accurate information, enabling the water resource to be
used sustainably.


**Methods**


**DO18.3.2.ii** Require water meters to be installed for all new and existing
consented abstractions, and require records to be kept to enable accurate monitoring of
actual water take and use.
**DO18.3.2.iii** Undertake annual monitoring of all water permits by 1 October
each year.


**5-100** **(31/08/15) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


**policy**
**DO19.1.10 new development**

_**Maintain existing water quality by requiring use of techniques to limit both non-**_
_**point discharges and control point source stormwater discharges caused by land**_
_**disturbing activities such as forestry, subdivisions and land development,**_
_**increased impervious surfaces, and commercial and industrial activities.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO19.1.10.i** These activities can cause sedimentation and contamination of
waterways. For this reason Council has erosion and sediment control guidelines and
requirements which are incorporated into section 9.3 of the NCC Land Development
Manual 2010. They control land disturbing activities on areas of land greater than 0.3ha.
**DO19.1.10.ii** Nelson’s population is predicted to increase by 24% from 2001 to
2021. The impacts of the population increase on stormwater are varied and significant.
These include:

         - increase in the amount of land covered in impervious surfaces which increase
stormwater runoff and contamination, and

          - increase in contamination and sedimentation from building activity, and commercial
and industrial activity, and

          - increase in urban transport resulting in increased pollution.


**Methods**


**DO19.1.10.iii** Promote and assist with establishment of riparian vegetation as a
means to filter contaminants and prevent sediment and contaminants from entering
water bodies.
**DO19.1.10.iv** Promote and assist with low impact design options for stormwater
management.
**DO19.1.10.v** Conditions and enforcement on earthworks consents.

**DO19.1.10.vi** Council will work with stakeholders to establish a memorandum of
understanding regarding erosion and sediment controls and compliance monitoring
procedures for forestry activities, including earthworks, roading, and harvesting.
**DO19.1.10.vii** Review the effectiveness of the Council’s approach to forestry
activities to ensure it is avoiding, remedying or mitigating adverse effects on water
bodies.

**policy**
**DO19.1.11 new and existing discharges to water**

_**To review all existing discharge permits (other than stormwater) by January 2006**_
_**and apply a standard condition so that the new water quality discharge standards**_
_**are fully complied with within five years of the freshwater plan change becoming**_
_**operative.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO19.1.11.i** “Existing discharge” is defined as a discharge which was lawfully
established and in use at the date of public notification of these freshwater provisions.
In order to achieve best practicable water quality it is necessary to review discharges
currently entering Nelson’s water bodies and to reduce the impacts of those discharges
where they do not meet the standard expected of new discharges.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/11/12)** **5-115**


**DO19.1.11.ii** This is consistent with sections 68(7) and 128 of the Resource
Management Act which state that:
a) where a regional plan includes a rule relating to minimum standards of water quality,
the plan may state whether the rule shall affect the exercise of existing resource
consents for activities which contravene the rule, and that the holders of resource
consents may comply with the terms of the rule, or rules, over specified periods, and
b) in order to enable minimum water quality standards set in an operative regional
water plan to be met, a consent authority may serve notice of its intention to review
the conditions on a resource consent. [Note: stormwater has been excluded from this
policy as it is covered in Policy DO19.1.8 (stormwater discharges) and Policy DO19.1.9
(improvements to stormwater discharges).]


**Methods**


**DO19.1.11.iii** Education about appropriate disposal methods and options,
particularly for swimming pool water, car wash water and water used to wash buildings
using detergents or chemicals. In most cases this water should be discharged to the
sewerage system.
**DO19.1.11.iv** Include a standard condition on each new discharge permit which
provides for review of the conditions of any resource consent for discharging a
contaminant to water bodies or land.

**policy**
**DO19.1.12 Water Quality** **(NPS – Freshwater Management 2014)**

_**1. When considering any application for a discharge, the consent authority must**_
_**have regard to the following matters:**_
_**(a)**_ _**the extent to which the discharge would avoid contamination that will have an**_
_**adverse effect on the life-supporting capacity of fresh water including on any**_
_**ecosystem associated with fresh water; and**_
_**(b)**_ _**the extent to which it is feasible and dependable that any more than minor**_
_**adverse effect on fresh water, and on any ecosystem associated with**_
_**freshwater, resulting from the discharge would be avoided; and**_
_**(c)**_ _**the extent to which the discharge would avoid contamination that will have an**_
_**adverse effect on the health of people and communities as affected by their**_
_**secondary contact with fresh water; and**_
_**(d)**_ _**the extent to which it is feasible and dependable that any more than minor**_
_**adverse effect on the health of people and communities as affected by their**_
_**secondary contact with freshwater resulting from the discharge would be**_
_**avoided.**_
_**2. This policy applies to the following discharges (including diffuse discharge by**_
_**any person or animal):**_
_(i)_ _**a new discharge; or**_
_(ii)_ _**a new change or increase in any discharge of any contaminant into fresh water,**_
_**or onto or into land in circumstances that may result in that contaminant (or,**_
_**as a result of any natural process from the discharge of that contaminant, any**_
_**other contaminant) entering fresh water.**_
_**3. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this policy do not apply to any application for consent**_
_**first lodged before the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management**_
_**2011 took effect on 1 July 2011.**_
_**4. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this policy do not apply to any application for consent**_
_**first lodged before the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management**_
_**2014 took effect on 4 July 2014.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO19.1.12.i** This policy has been included (under section 55 RMA) as directed by the
National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management 2014.

#### **objective** **DO19.2 contamination of roundwater** **g**


_**Contamination of groundwater is avoided to ensure the highest practicable water quality.**_


**5-116** **(31/08/15) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO19.2.i** A range of activities have the potential to degrade groundwater
including fertiliser and pesticide use, irrigation and septic tank effluent, and hazardous
substances storage and use (including petrol and diesel tanks).
**DO19.2.ii** By the time contamination has been detected it is usually too late
to carry out preventative measures. Cleaning up contaminated groundwater can be
expensive and in some cases it may not be technically feasible. Contaminants remain in
groundwater for a long time (years) and can affect many existing uses. Therefore, the
priority for groundwater contamination should be avoidance rather than mitigation.

**policy**
**DO19.2.1** **Effect of land use activities on groundwater**
_**Ensure that land use activities are managed so that groundwater quality is not**_
_**adversely affected.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO19.2.1.i** This policy is adopted to minimise and, as far as possible, avoid the
potential for long term contamination of groundwater resources from leaching liquid
contaminants. It is important to maintain existing groundwater quality in Nelson’s
aquifers to provide for the existing and potential uses of that water.


**Methods**


**DO19.2.1.ii** Require applicants to provide information about the quality of any
proposed discharge (what Class it is) based on the water quality standards in
Appendices 28.5 – 28.7.
**DO19.2.1.iii** Best practicable option for mitigating and avoiding the effects of
discharges.
**DO19.2.1.iv** Provide information on minimising use of pesticides, oils, and other
potential contaminants to people in key recharge areas.
**DO19.2.1.v** Ensure that land use activities are managed so that groundwater
quality is not adversely affected.
**DO19.2.1.vi** Increase Council knowledge of groundwater sources by compiling
current information and, as a condition on consents for new bores, requiring new
information to be provided to the Council.

#### **DO19e  environmental results anticipated and** **performance indicators**

The following results are expected to be achieved by the foregoing objectives, policies
and methods. The means of monitoring whether this Plan achieves the necessary
outcomes are also detailed below.

**Nelson Resource Management Plan (31/08/15)** **5- 117**


#### **DO20 Freshwater management**

**DO20.i** The issues in regard to freshwater management are discussed in
Chapter 4 (particularly RI18).

#### **objective** **DO20.1 integrated water management**


_**A management approach that integrates the expertise of relevant statutory authorities and**_
_**manawhenua iwi and other stakeholders in the community, and recognises the responsibilities they**_
_**have for the protection and use of freshwater resources.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO20.1.i** Water resource knowledge and information links are fundamental to
the assessment of freshwater resources and subsequent management decisions.
Without knowledge and information, water management decisions may be inaccurate or
ineffective. Building a comprehensive knowledge base requires the development of
working relationships and effective data exchange between people and agencies
working in different fields of expertise and for different organisations such as Federated
Farmers, New Zealand Forest Owners Association, New Zealand Farm Forestry
Association and the rural land owners of the district.
Examples of collaboration include:

          - Nelson City Council and Tasman District Council have combined website technology to
provide the public with up to date river flow data for all catchments.

         - The Department of Conservation monitors and provides the Council with information
on fish species occurring in Nelson rivers.

         - Iwi, Department of Conservation, Tasman District Council and Nelson City Council
collectively provide ‘Waimaori’, a monitoring, education and action programme that
encourages schools and communities to become kaitiakitanga (guardians) of their
local streams.

         - Currently forestry owners Weyerhaeuser and Hancock Forest Management both have
environmental committees or forums which provide opportunities for sharing
knowledge and experience between the forestry companies and Department of
Conservation, Fish and Game Council, and territorial authorities Tasman District
Council and Nelson City Council.

         - Rural land owners and the Council are working together to recreate habitats along
river margins.

**policy**
**DO20.1.1** **other management plans**
_**Decisions on water management are made having regard to relevant management**_
_**plans prepared by manawhenua iwi and statutory authorities such as the**_
_**Department of Conservation, Nelson Marlborough Fish & Game Council and Nelson**_
_**City Council.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**DO20.1.1.i** The Department of Conservation and the Nelson Marlborough Fish &
Game Council both have statutory responsibilities to advocate for water quality and
aquatic habitats. Manawhenua iwi also have a key role as kaitiaki (guardians) of water
resources. Any management plans prepared by such agencies need to be considered
when making decisions affecting freshwater resources because it is important for all
water management agencies and iwi to work in an integrated and co-operative way to
achieve sustainable management of freshwater resources.


**5-118** **(12/11/12) Nelson Resource Management Plan**


**policy**
**RU1.2** **range** **of activities**


_**A wide range of activities which are compatible with the objectives and policies**_
_**and in particular policy RU1.1 should be allowed to occur.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**RU1.2.i** Providing that activities do not conflict with the overall objectives and
policies for the Zone, they will generally be permitted. This philosophy means that
while there will be no lists of activities which will generally be provided for in the
Zone, any activity which can be demonstrated not to have the adverse effects this Plan
is seeking to avoid, can proceed.
**Method**


**RU1.2.ii** Structure this Plan to focus on effects and avoid the listing of activities.


**policy**
**RU1.3 management** **of effects** **of connections** **on structure** **plans**


_**The provision for, and development of, road, walkway and cycleway linkages**_
_**within Rural Zones where these have been identified on Structure Plans, at a time**_
_**and in a manner that does not result in unreasonable reverse sensitivity effects**_
_**with other land use activities.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**RU1.3.i** Indicative roads and walkways/cycleways have been identified on
Structure Plans where these have been determined to be important in achieving
enhanced transportation and recreational outcomes, both within rural areas and/or
between urban neighbourhoods. It is not the intention that these unreasonably impact
on farming, rural industry or other legitimate rural land use practices. The Council will
work closely with land owners and developers to ensure the timely setting aside of land
and/or construction of such linkages. Conversely, it is anticipated that land owners will
not undertake works, activities or place structures within these potential corridors of a
nature, or in a manner, that will compromise the attainment of those future
connections.


**Methods**


**RU1.3.ii** Exercise discretion when considering the timing of land to be set aside
and/or constructed for road, walkway or cycleway purposes within those indicative
alignments shown on a Structure Plan.
**RU1.3.iii** Rules to avoid subdivision layout, structures or activities that may
compromise the achievement of those indicative road, walkway or cycleway
connections shown on a Structure Plan.
**RU1.3.iv** For additional methods, refer Policy DO10.1.7.

#### **objective** **RU2 rural character**


_**Maintenance or enhancement of an environment dominated by open space and natural features.**_


**Reasons**


**RU2.i** The natural character on which the rural character is based relies on
the maintenance of natural ecosystems such as riparian, riverine and estuarine
systems, and on the remnants of original vegetation together with significantly
regenerated areas. Should these be removed from the Nelson area, the rural area
would lose much of its unique qualities which differentiate it from many other parts of
the country. In addition to natural features, pastoral agriculture and forestry
contribute to the rural character.


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (31/08/15)** **12-3**


**RU2.ii** The rural environment can be separated into three distinct areas.
These are as follows:


a) The **main area of the Rural Zone**, being the steeper hill areas, away from the
coast and generally separated from the urban environment. This area tends to
form the secondary backdrop to the city, and has a low level of apparent
modification to the landscape. It does however contain significant areas of exotic
forest development, which will remain a dynamic environment as varying age
classes of forest are harvested and replanted. It also contains smaller areas of
pastoral farming, and areas of land in various states of reversion to exotic, and in
the longer term, indigenous vegetation. The area contains a very low level of
development in terms of structures, as properties tend to be large, with a high
degree of separation between clusters of buildings.


b) The **Small Holdings Area** is generally contained within valley floors or between
urban development and the Rural Zone. The pattern of development is much
greater in this area, with structures at more regular intervals, but still at a low
level of density with significant areas of land in between. Small holdings are not
rural residential areas, but are large enough to provide the opportunity for a range
of rural activities. The character is predominantly rural rather than residential.
Use of the land within this area is far more varied, with horticultural activities
interspersed in between areas of grazing, and occasionally areas of indigenous
vegetation particularly in the Lud and Teal Valleys. Part of the Nelson South area
(land accessed off Champion Road and Hill St North) has been identified as a Rural
– Higher Density Small Holding Area, because of its location adjacent to the
Residential Zone, its small size and its role as a buffer to adjoining Rural Zone
Land.


Parts of the Marsden and Enner Glynn Valley area have also been identified as a
Rural Zone – Higher Density Small Holding Area, because of the limited productive
potential of these areas due to their topography and small size, and in the case of
upper Marsden Valley, the ability to cluster development to mitigate visual
amenity effects in relation to the open rural character of the visible slopes. The
Higher Density Small Holdings Area, as it relates to land within Schedule I
(Marsden Valley, eastern area Rural Zone – Higher Density Small Holdings Area),
Schedule V (Marsden Hills), Schedule E (Ngawhatu Residential Area) to the rear of
the Residential Zone and adjoining part of the Rural Zoned farmland along the
Southern boundary, and Schedule W (Enner Glynn and Upper Brook Valley)
provides for allotments of an average of 1 ha, but with a minimum subdivision
area of 2,000m [2] subject to the provision of reticulated services. This zoning will
provide a transition between Residential and Rural areas and, as it relates to the
more visually prominent area just below the Barnicoat Range, with development
sensitive landscape values. This significant variation in the average density, and
the minimum lot size, is to encourage small enclaves/clusters of serviced
development with significant open space separating these. Geotechnical
constraints within this area will also restrict development to a limited number of
enclaves of settlement. In Marsden Valley (Schedule I, Chapter 7, Residential
Zone) the western Rural Zone – Higher Density Small Holdings Area has a site size
requirement of 6000m [2] average and 2000m [2] minimum with a requirement for
reticulated services. This recognises that this area is surrounded by Residential
zoning and is therefore not located in a rural or rural to residential transition
environment. As per other specified areas of Rural Zone – Higher Density Small
Holdings Areas the provisions allow for clustering of development.
Within the Maitai Valley, adjoining the existing urban area, a high density Small
Holdings Area has been defined. This is an extension of similar existing
development.
Since the plan was notified in 1996, there has been a trend of undersize
subdivisions in the North Nelson Rural Zone and Rural Small Holdings area. A plan
change was notified in 2005 to make undersize subdivisions between The Glen

                                   Road and Whangamoa Saddle non complying activities. This is an interim measure
to halt this trend and avoid further adverse effects on rural character, until such
time as a more structured and coordinated framework for subdivision is in

place. [05/01]


c) The **coastal environment** is that area between the coast and generally the first
ridgeline to the landward side of the coast. The pattern of development in this
area has generally been very low key, with a low level of development of
structures and patterns of development. Two areas of close subdivision occur
within this overlay, being the settlement at the Glen, and a cluster of dwellings at
Cable Bay. It is seen as a matter of priority through the Act, the New Zealand
Coastal Policy Statement and of this Plan that these areas remain limited in
extent.


**RU2.iii** Management of the character of the various parts of the rural
environment is important to maintain Nelson’s image as a pleasant green environment
where there is ready access to passive and recreational activities. The rural area also
contains significant natural and cultural features, and significant areas of indigenous
flora and fauna which form part of Nelson’s heritage, and in some cases represent only
remnants of what Nelson once possessed. Protection, and preferably preservation, is
seen as important to maintain Nelson’s heritage for present and future generations,
and for scientific as well as cultural reasons.


**policy**
**RU2.1** **density - subdivision**


_**Subdivision patterns should ensure that sufficiently large separations are**_
_**maintained between clusters of buildings, or be designed such that any adverse**_
_**effects on the rural character are avoided or mitigated, provided that a site**_
_**meets a subdivision size permitted in this Plan.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**RU2.1.i** Maintaining large site sizes in the extensive rural area will ensure that
the rural character is not compromised by numerous clusters of buildings dotted across
the landscape as each individual property establishes a dwelling and associated
outbuildings. Within the Small Holdings Area, it is also important to retain the open
space character, although obviously more densely settled, to provide a rural feel which
distinguishes the area from the densely settled urban environment. There may,
however, be a range of ways in which the open space character may be maintained,
other than the use of minimum site size, depending on the circumstances. There is
opportunity to consider clusters of dwellings, which may be appropriate in some
situations for reasons of landscape amenity, stability or local servicing for example,
providing that the general landscape character is not compromised.


**RU2.1.iA** For objectives and policies relevant to the Rural Zone – Higher Density
Small Holdings Area (Schedule I) refer to RE4 Marsden Valley (Schedule I), Chapter 7.


**RU2.1.iB** Clustering of development with open space separating clusters in the
Rural Zone - Higher Density Small Holdings Area is encouraged in order to avoid
dispersed development dominating the landform.

_**Small land holdings should be of sufficient size to provide for:**_


_**a)**_ _**maintenance of general rural character and amenities, and**_
_**b)**_ _**being visually unobtrusive, utilising topography to avoid visual impacts, and**_
_**c)**_ _**servicing from existing infrastructure, especially roads, and**_
_**d)**_ _**privacy and separation of dwellings, and**_

_**transport efficiency.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**RU2.2.i** Small rural land holdings can disrupt and destroy the rural values where
open space and natural features predominate. The presence of small holdings may
conflict with adjoining land used for productive purposes. Structures and new road
construction particularly have adverse effects. Areas where the effects are not so
marked, such as small valleys which can not be readily viewed by the public, if roads
are already in place, are more likely to comply with this policy than elsewhere.


**RU2.2.iA** For objectives and policies relevant to the Rural Zone – Higher Density
Small Holdings Area (Schedule I) refer to RE4 Marsden Valley (Schedule I), Chapter 7.


**Methods**


**RU2.2.ii** Map Small Holdings Area where smaller holdings will be accepted as
complying with the policy.
**RU2.2.iii** Rules regulating allotment sizes in Small Holdings Area to allow smaller
size.
**RU2.2.iv** Exercise discretion on applications for subdivisions and building
additional residential units.


**policy**
**RU2.3** **scale, height and density of structures**


_**The scale, height, and density of structures should be such that they do not**_
_**compromise the character of the area, or where the character of an area is**_
_**already compromised by development, do not detract further from the amenity of**_
_**the area.**_


**Explanation and Reasons**


**RU2.3.i** Buildings and structures which are not in harmony with the rural
landscape have the potential to almost permanently affect the appearance and rural
character of the Zone. An example might be a large silo located in a dominant part of
the landscape (which might not be a problem tucked under a spur).


**Method**


**RU2.3.ii** Rules for maximum building heights, bulk and location.


**policy**
**RU2.4** **alteration of the** **contour of the land**


**Any adverse visual effects of activities which alter the contour of the land, such as**
**filling, land contouring, and excavation should be avoided, remedied, or mitigated.**


**Explanation and Reasons**


**RU2.4.i** Land recontouring activities have the potential to permanently alter
the appearance of the landscape. Such effects may not be limited to the areas
actually disturbed, but may relate to the loss of integrity of an adjacent or nearby
feature. While there will be circumstances where such effects are unavoidable, they
can be mitigated against by ensuring they do not affect any areas which can be readily
viewed by the public as a whole, such as from traffic corridors and public open space,
or remedied by ensuring that affected areas are restored or at least rehabilitated to an
acceptable level from a landscape perspective.


**Methods**


**RU2.4.ii** Rules relating to land disturbance.
**RU2.4.iii** Exercise discretion where any land recontouring occurs.

# **appendix 6** **riparian and** **coastal margin** **overlays**

#### **AP6 overview**

**AP6.i** This appendix lists all those riparian and coastal margins identified as
having riparian values.

#### **AP6.1 riparian and coastal margins with identified** **riparian values**


**AP6.1.i** Table 6.1 contains a listing of identified riparian values of the rivers and
streams throughout the Nelson City Council area. The purpose of the table is to provide
information on relevant riparian values of particular margins, to be taken into account at
the time any resource consent or plan change is considered.


**AP6.1.ii** Riparian values identified in tables 6.1 and 6.2 include conservation, access,
hazard mitigation, and recreation. Conservation values are further defined under
AP6.1.iii, and the remaining values are further defined as follows:


Access – includes both people and wildlife. Public access in the form of public
ownership, walkways, cycle ways and where appropriate residential roading are all
values associated with access. Access for wildlife is provided through biodiversity
corridors provided by riparian and coastal margins.


Hazard Mitigation – includes flooding, ponding and the low impact management of
stormwater.


Recreation – includes water sports as well as recreational walkway, cycleway connections
and passive recreation opportunities (e.g. viewing and seating areas).


**AP6.1.iii** Conservation values are assigned into three categories dependent on the
size and nature of the river concerned.


_**Priority 1 conservation values**_


These include the main stem of larger rivers. These reaches have a range of values
including:


a) Trout fishing, swimming, walking, passive recreation, kayaking and other boating
b) Identified wildlife corridors/significant native riparian vegetation
c) Flood management zones
d) Water quality being managed for fishery and contact recreation purposes


**Nelson Resource Management Plan (12/11/12)** **A6-1**


_**Priority 2 conservation values**_


These include smaller rivers and significant tributaries of larger rivers. Management of
these areas is primarily to protect habitats of fish and fowl and for water quality
purposes. These reaches have a range of values including:


a) Identified trout spawning streams, whitebait spawning streams, wildlife habitat
streams especially for waterfowl, waterbodies with rare species
b) Permanently flowing streams greater than 3 m bank width as native fish habitat
(unless lacking fishery values confirmed by survey)
c) Spring fed creeks or any having high water clarity
d) Water quality being managed for aquatic ecosystems or water supply purposes


_**Priority 3 conservation values**_


These include small first order streams which may need some protection to maintain
water quality. The degree of protection is largely dependent on slope. There is little
benefit in protecting stream margins on high slope angles where suitable land use
controls are more appropriate.


Where appropriate, conditions may be placed on resource consents to avoid, remedy or
mitigate adverse effects on the values identified. Such conditions could include, but
would not be restricted to matters such as:


a) Timing of earthworks.
b) Revegetation following earthworks.
c) Control of stormwater and other discharges.
d) Location of structures.
e) Protection of significant vegetation.
f) Protection of instream habitats.
g) Water Quality.


**AP6.1.iv** Esplanade reserves or strips not specified in Table 6.2 of Appendix 6 will
only be required as a condition of a resource consent or plan change where they are the
only practical means of avoiding, remedying or mitigating the adverse effects from an
activity to which the consent relates. Examples of situations where this could occur
include:


a) A resource consent or plan change for a hotel or tourism development next to a
river reach of high value for access or conservation purposes.


b) The rezoning of an area from rural to residential or a resource consent, or plan
change creating lots of a smaller size than provided for in the area as a controlled
activity and adjoining a riparian margin of significant value for conservation, access
or hazard mitigation purposes.

#### **AP 6.2  riparian or coastal areas with priority values**

**AP6.2.i** Table 6.2 identifies riparian and coastal land with priority values.
Esplanade reserves will be set aside, or esplanade strips created, in these areas upon
subdivision and road stopping. Land uses in esplanade areas are also regulated by zone
rules.


**AP6.2.ii** The esplanade requirements column indicates whether an esplanade reserve
or esplanade strip is required and its width from the river bank or mean high water
springs in metres (eg. 20 m). One or both banks may be indicated.


**AP6.2.iii** Where land that is referred to in the Table is in the Coastal Environment
Overlay, the requirements for that Overlay prevail over any other requirements in the
Table. Where land referred to in the Table is in the Small Holdings Area, the
requirements for that Area prevail over any requirements stated for the Rural Zone.


**AP6.2.iv** Where the taking of an esplanade reserve or creation of an esplanade strip
results in an unworkable severance of land (for example a residual narrow strip between
the reserve or strip to be created and the property boundary), Council will consider
rationalising the esplanade requirements contained within Table 6.2 to take into account
an such severance.

One cubic<br>metre per household per day is considered a realistic and easily<br>monitored limit to apply to each household. Failure to comply with the<br>permitted activity conditions may result in the Council requiring the<br>installation of meters and enforcement of the 1m3 allocation limit.<br>Abstractions need to be balanced against the ecological bottom line<br>and providing for other values.  Efficient water use is particularly<br>important in Nelson, where the small size of the rivers and streams<br>means that a water take has the potential for a proportionally more<br>significant effect on the overall river or stream values.<br>Minimum flows, trigger flows and allocation limits have been set for<br>specific rivers.<br>Minimum flows, below which no further water should be taken, have<br>been set in order to leave enough water in the rivers and streams to<br>protect instream values.<br>Trigger flows are set at 10% above minimum flow.  When flow levels<br>drop to this level, all non-essential water takes from that river will be<br>suspended, except where an approved water conservation plan<br>exists.<br>Note: This diagram is for illustrative purposes only. Trigger flow and<br>minimum flow are defined in Chapter 2, and the specific levels for<br>each water body are listed in Appendix 28.2.<br>i) For all flows greater than trigger flow no restrictions will apply<br>ii) For all flows less than the trigger flow and greater than the minimum<br>flow restrictions will apply to both domestic takes and consented<br>takes.<br>iii) For all flows equal to or less than the minimum flows, all<br>abstractions must cease except for fire fighting purposes.<br>The following policies set out the process to be followed for water<br>abstraction from surface water:<br>DO18.1.1 and DO18.1.2 (flow regimes)<br>DO18.3.1 (water permits)<br>DO18.3.2 (monitoring water abstraction)<br>DO18.3.3 (expiry and duration of water permits)<br>DO18.3.5 – DO18.3.8 (allocation limits)<br>DO18.3.9 (water restrictions)<br>DO18.3.10 (permitted abstractions)<br>DO18.3.12 (monitoring fee)<br>DO18.4.1 (diversion of water)<br>Note: Assessment criteria FW12.4 k) and l) have been inserted from<br>Policy B7 - National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management<br>2014 (under section 55 RMA)|

|FWr.20.4<br>Assessment matters (for controlled, restricted discretionary and discretionary<br>activities)**: **<br>a) whether the discharge has a reasonable potential to result in a loss of<br>sensitive or important habitat, substantially interfere with the existing or<br>characteristic uses of the water body, result in damage to the ecosystem, or<br>adversely affect public health.<br>b) whether the discharge will create a barrier to the migration or movement of<br>native species and trout to a degree that has the potential to cause damage<br>to the ecosystem.<br>c) the classification of the water body and the priority for its enhancement (see<br>Appendix 28.4).<br>d) the sensitivity of the receiving environment.<br>e) in the case of wetlands, whether it is naturally occurring or artificially created.<br>If it was artificially created, the purpose for which it was created (eg<br>stormwater management or wastewater treatment).<br>f) provision for review of consent conditions if the discharge has unforeseen<br>effects on water quality<br>g) whether the discharge will contribute to a waterbody continuing to have a<br>Class D or E water quality standard.<br>**Assessment criteria for non-complying activities**<br>a) methods of prevention, control and treatment appropriate to the discharge<br>b) siting, technological, and management options<br>c) loss of sensitive or important habitat<br>d) interference with the existing or characteristic uses of the water body<br>e) any damage to the ecosystem, or adverse effects on public health<br>f) whether the discharge existed prior to notification<br>g) whether the volume of water in the effluent is providing a greater benefit to<br>the existing or characteristic uses of the water body due to flow augmentation<br>h) whether the exceedance is necessary to accommodate important economic<br>or social development.|FWr.20.5<br>The water quality of Nelson’s rivers has been assessed and classified<br>into five categories from Class A (excellent) to Class E (very<br>degraded).<br>Detail of the qualities and values of these classes is in Appendix 28.5.<br>The 2002 classification of Nelson waterways is in Appendix 28.4.<br>Where a water body is not listed in Appendix 28.4, its water quality<br>classification should be determined by assessing a range of physical,<br>chemical and biotic parameters as described in Cawthron Report<br>No.774 (October 2002).<br>In order to set clear management objectives for each water body it is<br>necessary to establish the current water quality of Nelson’s rivers and<br>streams and then set minimum standards for maintaining that level of<br>water quality.  Classification standards provide a “baseline” below<br>which water quality should not be degraded.<br>Control of discharges is necessary to work towards Policy DO19.1.5,<br>which is that no water bodies should be of a quality less than Class C<br>and Policy 19.1.12, and meets the National Objective Framework of<br>the National Policy Statement – Freshwater Management.<br>Note: swimming pool water is considered free of chemicals when a<br>pool has been left open to sunlight for 14 days, the level of chlorine<br>does not register on any home testing kit, and no smell of chlorine<br>remains.<br>The following district wide policies are relevant to this rule:<br>DO19.1.1 – DO19.1.5 (policies for classes A to E)<br>DO19.1.11 (new and existing discharges to water)|
