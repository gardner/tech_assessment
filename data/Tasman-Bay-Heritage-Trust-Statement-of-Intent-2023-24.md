**Tasman Bays Heritage Trust**


**Statement of Intent 2023-2024**


**INTRODUCTION**


This Statement of Intent (SOI) is submitted by the Tasman Bays Heritage Trust (‘the Trust’), operating

as Nelson Provincial Museum (‘the Museum’), a Council Controlled Organisation of Nelson City

Council and Tasman District Council (‘the Stakeholders’), and in accordance with Section 64 of the

Local Government Act 2002 and its amendments, and sets out the intentions and expectations of the

Trust for the period 1 July 2023 – 30 June 2024.


In presenting this SOI we wish to thank the Nelson City Council and Tasman District Council for their

continued support of Tasman Bays Heritage Trust. We are confident that our strategic plan will

enhance the value of the Museum to our communities, adding to the vibrancy and attractiveness of

the region as a destination for visitors and for our resident communities, and enable us to protect

and share the region’s heritage treasures for future Nelson Tasman generations.

**PURPOSE STATEMENT**


To care for, strengthen and make widely accessible the taonga and heritage collections of Nelson

Tasman; and to create unforgettable experiences that stimulate awareness, celebrate diversity and

entertain.


**STRATEGIC GOALS 2023/24 FY**


This SOI defines five strategic objectives with associated activities and key performance indicators

(KPIs), each of which underpin the strategic direction for the next three years. These are derived

from the priorities and stated objectives of the Trust, combined with the expressed expectations of

our two stakeholder Councils:


1. To plan for and commence a capital works project which will safely and appropriately house and

care for the Nelson Tasman Regional Heritage Collection;


2. To be a highly valued visitor destination, educational provider and venue for cultural and
community connection;


3. To actively support and collaborate with iwi and Nelson Tasman cultural heritage organisations;


4. To continue to develop and provide appropriate care for a strong Collection which is relevant and

accessible to, and valued by, Nelson Tasman communities;


5. To improve our sustainability performance.

**1.** **To plan for and commence a capital works project which will safely and appropriately**

**house and care for the Nelson Tasman Regional Heritage Collection**


The Trust’s key strategic goal for the 2023/24 FY is to **plan for and commence a capital works**
**project which will safely and appropriately house and care for the Nelson Tasman Regional**
**Heritage Collection** .


As is widely understood in the Nelson Tasman community, the Isel Park Research Facility is at the

end of its functional life. A replacement is urgently required to provide ongoing care for the

Museum’s nationally – and internationally - significant Regional Collection.


The planned replacement - working title Archives Research and Collections Facility (ARC) - has been

discussed and workshopped with Councils over the last five years. These discussions have included

approval of the Business Case, a Joint Committee Working Group to decide on the optimum location,

and subsequent approval to purchase the Church Street site.


The ARC Facility will not only deliver on the Museum’s core objective of protecting the Regional

Collection, but it will also increase access to it. The central city site will add to the vibrancy of the

area and deliver upon NCC’s Taonga Tuku Iho Cultural Heritage Strategy. Easy access to cultural and

heritage is a vital part of ‘liveable cities’ and this project will enable iwi, multi-generational families,

migrant and refugee-background communities, students and visitors to easily connect with our

region’s unique and precious history. Access to local history is a key part of the Ministry of
Education’s Aotearoa New Zealand Histories curriculum and our schools have told us they need the

easy access to the collections for senior students that this central-city facility will provide.


We are grateful to Nelson City Council and Tasman District Council for allocating $3.165m and $3.2m
respectively towards the ARC project in their Long-Term Plans. Ongoing support from both Councils
is required to deliver on financial commitments, demonstrate support for the project, and reassure
other potential funders that the fundraising target is achievable.


Following approval of the preliminary design in the 23FY, and the processing of the resource consent

application by Nelson City Council, the focus for the remainder of the 2023 calendar year is the

Detailed Design. Specifically, this will include obtaining Iwi guidance and input for Kaupapa Māori

design, building consent processing, and updating the cost plan. Please see Appendix A for further

detail on the project deliverables.


As resource consent a requirement of significant funders, grant applications to Lottery Grants Board

and central government funds can now be formally submitted (in the expectation that NCC consents

have been approved in March 2023.). The local community fundraising campaign will be well

underway by the time a Go-No Go decision is required at the end of the 2023 calendar year.


The ARC Facility Capital Project has a strong governance and advisory structure. The build aspect is

being overseen by a sub-committee co-chaired by Trustees Brendon Silcock and Derek Shaw

together with external expert advisors John Hambleton and Ian MacLennan. This group works
closely with the project managers Cameron Gibson Wells (CGW) and the Museum’s internal Project

Manager Belinda Wheatley, appointed specifically to deliver the project.


The Fundraising committee is by TBHT Deputy Chair Emma Thompson, with fellow Trustee Jo Brady

adding her considerable expertise in the area. The Fundraising Campaign will deliver strong and

vibrant engagement, and has been designed by Downing Creative.

With support from both Councils, central government and the community, construction will

commence in early 2024. The building of the new facility represents a significant investment in the

Nelson Tasman region and its future.


**2.** **To be a highly valued visitor destination, educational provider and venue for cultural and**


**community connection**


We aim to be a vibrant, dynamic, and contemporary institution that is relevant to, and inclusive of,

all people in the Nelson Tasman region. We will continue to grow our reputation as a provider of

quality content and dynamic storytelling with a strong connection to local communities. We will

deliver compelling narratives and outstanding interpretation through a variety of formats and media

including onsite experiences, engaging special exhibitions, educational and outreach programmes,

and digital channels.


The Museum makes a significant contribution to Council Community Outcomes in the Nelson

Tasman region. As identified in the recent BERL report into ‘The Value of Museums and Galleries in
Aotearoa’ [1], museums make quantifiable contributions to the Economic, Cultural, Social and

Environmental Wellbeing of their rohe. Research demonstrates that our communities feel

passionately about both our value, and our vital role in creating liveable cities.


_**Exhibitions**_


We are looking forward to hosting the touring exhibition _‘Codebreakers: Women in Games’_ (Aug –

Nov 2023). This interactive exhibition is on tour from ACMI in Australia and celebrates the

achievements of Australian and New Zealand women working in video games. It includes the work of

Māori designer Maru Nihoniho - founder and managing director of Metia Interactive. This exhibition

will be an excellent way to connect with some rangatahi who tend not to visit museums but will be

attracted to learn about gaming technology.


The Museum is proud to curate an exhibition of local photographer Melissa Banks’ images of kapa

haka, and there are plans to tour this exhibition nationally. We will also host a display from the

Nelson Embroiderer’s Guild in October, _‘Sew, That’s Embroidery’_ .


Our summer exhibition is currently in negotiation, but we are confident that it will be a strong

attractor over our region’s high-visitor season.


_**Visitation**_


From 2016 to 2020, visitation to the Museum increased significantly, bringing us in line with other

high-performing regional museums (despite smaller budgets and staff numbers). Unfortunately,

COVID-19 then hit our visitation and heavily impacted our numbers. Going forward, with the return

of international visitors, we are expecting visitation will bounce-back.


The Museum has set a visitation target of 54,000 (excluding education audiences, who are measured

separately) for the 2024 FY. In setting this target, we looked at trends both across the region and

across the museum sector. NRDA research suggests that international visitation levels won’t return
to pre-pandemic levels until 24/25FY. Our colleagues in similar sized regional museums are

expecting a drop of 10% on pre-pandemic levels.

Our school programme is funded by the Ministry of Education through the new Enriching Local

Curriculum programme on a 3.5year contract. We were selected to provide these services through a

highly-competitive tender process. Our success is a vote of confidence in the Museum’s ability to

deliver upon the new Aotearoa New Zealand Histories curriculum by sharing local stories and

knowledge including mana whenua purakau.


It is to be noted though that the value of Ministry of Education funding has not increased materially

in over seven years, although the expectation is that it now also covers early childhood education.

Our visitation target for student visits remains at 5,500, but our focus of course is quality over

quantity. Teacher satisfaction levels are currently tracking at 100%.


organisations, rather than specifying a set number of hours. This will enable our Collections team to

both focus on preparing for the relocation, and to be able to be more responsive when those

requests do come in. We will also organise at least two regional hui on topics relevant to all

participants.


**4)** **To continue to develop and provide appropriate care for a strong Collection which is relevant**
**and accessible to, and valued by, Nelson Tasman communities;**


The Trust’s Collections Management Policy empowers us to collect objects with strong local

significance. Active measures are taken to acquire items for the Collection that represent our


5


region’s rich history and unique biodiversity. In addition to securing significant historic items for the

Regional Heritage Collection as they become available, we also collect objects relating to significant

contemporary events (including the 2022 floods) and local individuals, artisans and businesses.

These objects will better enable our successors to tell the history of today.


This year the focus of the Collection staff will be on auditing/updating records, measuring and

packing objects to be move-ready when the ARC building is completed. This is a massive task which

will require additional resource – this has been budgeted within the ARC project budget over the

next two FY. This focus is likely to require curatorial and collection staff to be involved in fewer

outreach programmes this year.


**5). To improve our sustainability performance**


Our focus on preserving the past for future generations means that we are also very conscious of the
need to safeguard natural resources for the future too. As a scientific institution, we have a role in
disseminating research and information about the climate issues.


The Museum places sustainability front and centre of all our operations. A staff Sustainability

Committee meets monthly to identify areas for improvement and to workshop solutions. In recent

years we commissioned an Audit and Energy Management plan from EMSOL, and we are rolling out

implementations of many of its recommendations.


A strong opportunity for the Museum to reduce our energy footprint is thought the ARC Facility

project. This year we are undertaking to measure the ecological impact of the planned collection

move and to identify at least one way to reduce this – for example through sustainable packaging.

We are also investigating solar power options to reduce ongoing energy consumption, a significant

and rising operational cost.


By these actions the Museum can demonstrate good organisational citizenship, community

leadership, best practice sustainability and make our own contribution to addressing the pressing

global challenges of climate change.

**Alignment with Joint Community Outcomes**


The Museum makes a significant contribution to Joint Community Outcomes in the Nelson Tasman

region. As identified in the recent BERL report into ‘The Value of Museums and Galleries in
Aotearoa’ [2], museums make quantifiable contributions to the Economic, Cultural, Social and

Environmental Wellbeing of their rohe. Research demonstrates that our communities feel

passionately about both our value, and our vital role in creating liveable cities.


_**1.**_ _**Our unique natural environment is healthy and protected**_
The Museum profiles a variety of environmental issues and encourages engagement with, and
protection of, our regional biodiversity through education, events and exhibitions. Recently, for
example, the Museum partnered with both the Arts Festival and Brook Waimarama Sanctuary to tell
stories of climate action and safeguarding our local biodiversity. We are implementing internal
initiatives and measures for sustainability as outlined in Goal 5 of our Statement of Intent.


_**2.**_ _**Our urban and rural environments are people friendly, well-planned, and sustainably managed**_
The Museum is a welcoming and engaging social space which contributes significantly to the
activation of the Upper Trafalgar precinct. The Museum is free to visit for Nelson Tasman residents
(except for occasional major touring exhibitions for which there may be a small entry fee based on a
cost recovery basis). Our contribution to the vibrancy of the region provides community engagement
in the heart of the city, and the new ARC Facility will greatly enhance our residents’ connection to
their heritage. We will continue to support cultural heritage activities across the region through
outreach to district museums, galleries, libraries, marae, and other heritage facilities and
organisations.


_**3.**_ _**Our infrastructure is efficient, cost effective and meets current and future needs**_
The Archive, Research and Collections Facility capital works project will deliver a facility that
provides the most cost-effective, appropriate and long-term solution to care for the Regional
Heritage Collection for future generations.


The Museum is tightly financially managed, as can be seen in the financial results of prior years. We
a have a low-threshold for risk and The Trust maintains an Asset Register and Building Maintenance

Schedule.


_**4.**_ _**Our communities are healthy, safe, inclusive and resilient**_
Museums provide opportunities for community engagement, lifelong learning and engaging
experiences. These have been widely identified as key components of Liveable Cities. Our core
activities are free for Nelson Tasman residents and our programming will increasingly cater to the
diversity of the region. Our public programmes focus on inclusivity. Bespoke programmes are
available for visitors with disabilities or neural diversity. We are currently working with Q Youth to
better cater to the rainbow community.


The ARC Facility will add to these activities and allow many more people the ability to connect with
their culture and heritage – a vital component of wellbeing - in the central city.

_**5.**_ _**Our communities have opportunities to celebrate and explore their heritage, identity and**_
_**creativity**_
Our core business is to enable local residents to connect with their heritage, both cultural and
environmental. We do this through a range of programmes at the Museum, in the community and
digitally, making the region’s treasures available for visitors and locals alike. We are focused on
ensuring engagement across the region as well as increasingly catering to a broader
demographic. The ARC Facility will greatly enhance this connection, as can be seen from its core role
delivering NCC’s Taonga Tuku Iho Cultural Heritage Strategy.


_**6.**_ _**Our communities have access to a range of social, cultural, educational and recreational**_
_**facilities and activities**_
We provide social engagement across demographics and opportunities for life-long learning,
recreation and leisure. Museum exhibitions provide significant opportunities for social and cultural
connection, and is a favourite recreational activity for many of the region’s families and older
demographics.


In the last year we have delivered free-of-charge programmes for thousands of school children, plus
tertiary groups, English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, pre-schoolers, aged communities, special
interest groups and the general public. The Museum has received a 3.5 year contract from the
Ministry of Education under the Enriching Local Curriculum fund, a vote of confidence in our ability
to deliver local histories and purakau in a meaningful and relevant way to students of all ages.


_**7.**_ _**Our Council provides leadership and fosters partnerships, a regional perspective and community**_

_**engagement**_
The Museum works with the community to create opportunities for engagement on-site, on-line and
in the community. We provide leadership and guidance within and across the sector, to support the
activities of local museums and heritage parks, heritage houses, marae, historic organisations,
galleries and libraries. Each year we work with Tuku 23 (the Heritage Festival), the Suter Art Gallery,
Richmond Public Library, the Historical Societies and many other organisations to create relevant
and engaging community engagement.


_**8.**_ _**Our region is supported by an innovative and sustainable economy**_
As arguably the most visited cultural tourism attraction in the region, the Museum supports and
complements the region’s tourism offerings. High-impact window displays, an enhanced digital
experience and an attractive retail area has markedly improved the Museum’s value proposition and
helps bring destination traffic to the Upper Trafalgar precinct. Our shop stocks and promotes local
artisans and makers, and visitors to our strong summer exhibition programme brings money into our
region.


We also attract innovative, highly-educated specialists and creative people from around New
Zealand and the world to work at the Museum, who contribute to the regional arts and cultural
sector and the local economy.


The ARC Facility is a major project and will provide a boost to local employment during its
construction. These workers will bring money into the central city which benefit small businesses
and be a visible signal of revitalisation.
