#### **1. Introduction**

**1.1.** **Purpose of the Statement of Intent**


This Statement of Intent (SoI) is presented by Nelson Regional Development Agency
(NRDA) in accordance with the requirements of Section 64 (1) of the Local
Government Act 2002 (LGA 2002). This SoI publicly states the proposed activities and
intentions of the Nelson Regional Development Agency (NRDA) for the three years 1
July 2021 to 30 June 2024, and the priorities to which those activities will contribute.
This SoI takes into consideration the shareholder Letter of Expectation 2021 [1] (LoE),
commitments and responsibilities to all funders including Central Government and
the private sector, and the resources available to NRDA.


It includes targeted performance measures and indicators, on the basis of
organisational accountability. This SoI does not capture everything NRDA does, but
rather highlights our key strategic priorities and work areas, particularly those that
have high impact on the regional economic development challenges.


This SoI aligns with and delivers against the Nelson Tasman Regeneration Plan 2021
– 2031 [2] through Project Kōkiri [3] methodology. It is underpinned by the Te Tauihu
Intergenerational Strategy [4] .


This SoI is updated annually. In 2024 this update includes extracted text from the
Nelson-Tasman Economic Briefing [5] February 2023 update


**1.2.** **About Nelson Regional Development Agency**


NRDA’s mission is to unlock the economic potential of Nelson Tasman to enable our
people and places to thrive. We do this by leading inclusive and regenerative
economic development, supporting our businesses and people to grow, and shaping
and amplifying our profile to attract people, business, and investment to the region.


The NRDA is a Council Controlled Organisation established on 1 July 2016 following
merger of the former Nelson Regional Economic Development Agency and Nelson
Tasman Tourism. NRDA is 100% owned by Nelson City Council. Partnership funding
contribution from Tasman District Council enables NRDA services to be delivered

with a Nelson Tasman combined regional focus.


NRDA maintains responsibilities as the official Regional Tourism Organisation (RTO)
for the Nelson Tasman Region, as the key regional agency responsible for fostering
and promotion of regional visitation development. NRDA is a member of Regional
[Tourism NZ: https://rtnz.org.nz/](https://rtnz.org.nz/)


**Our Governance:** The NRDA board are a group of independent directors with a
commitment to the future prosperity of our region. The board guides the strategic
direction of NRDA while monitoring business activities. Board members are
appointed by Nelson City Council.


**Our Team:** At 1 June 2023, NRDA employs 14 FTEs and engages with a wide range of

service providers to deliver our programme of work for the region. The team leads
strategy and delivers programmes in roles ranging from (but not limited to), regional
(investment and visitor) promotion, destination management, facilitating innovationfocused sector support, business capacity building and support, education to
employment projects, and events fund management.


**Our Collaboration Partners:** We rely on, and are committed to, strong strategic
partnerships and collaboration with a shared interest in unlocking the economic
potential of Nelson Tasman. We recognise Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and mana whenua ki
Te Tauihu as our treaty partners whom we must involve in all our decision-making.


We also collaborate and connect with the wider business community and public
sector and community advocacy groups such as the Nelson Tasman Regional Skills
Leadership Group, Business for Climate Action, Multicultural Nelson Tasman, the
Destination Management Plan Reference Group, and the, Kōkiri Forum roject Kōkiri
methodology supports enhanced levels of connectivity between local government,
Central Government agencies, mana whenua and the business community.

#### **2. Strategic Context**


**2.1.** **Key attributes of Nelson Tasman’s economy and people** **[6]**

    Nelson Tasman’s economy generated $6.2 billion of GDP in 2022 and had
58,618 filled jobs. This represents growth of 5.6% over the past year.


    - The region has three key production and processing foci – forestry,
horticulture, and the ocean economy, all of which have expanded strongly
over the past decade.


    - Other key industries of employment in Nelson Tasman include health care
and social assistance, construction, retail, professional services,
accommodation and food services, and education.


    - Many of Nelson Tasman’s attributes that appeal to visitors, also appeal to
locals, including natural beauty, a variety of outdoor pursuits, and high-quality
food and beverage offerings.


    - There are at least 288 Māori-owned businesses and a further 939 self
employed Māori across the Te Tauihu rohe (encompassing Nelson Tasman
and neighbouring Marlborough.


    The eight iwi of Te Tauihu have net assets approaching $1 billion and a track
record of collaboration.


    - Nelson-Tasman’s three main urban areas of Nelson, Richmond, and Motueka
are the region’s key employment hubs. These main urban areas had 79% of
the region’s employment in 2022.


    - Jobs growth over the past decade has been particularly rapid in Richmond
(4.5%pa) and Motueka (3.1%pa), while employment rose more slowly in Nelson
City (0.5%pa). By comparison, NZ average jobs growth was 3%.


    - Job numbers in other (mainly rural) areas grew by 2.8%pa over the same
period.


    - Nelson Tasman’s population continues to grow at a higher rate than NZ
average; increasing from 96,800 in 2012 to 113,200 in 2022, (representing 0.4%
growth compared to 0.3% nationally)

    - Most population growth has been driven by migration (92% over the last three
years).


    - International migration drove 67% of recent population growth over the past
three years, with domestic migration accounting for 24% of growth – 91%
altogether. This is a continuing trend – in 2021, this figure was 92%


    - The population has spread out, with 62% of growth outside Nelson City over
the past decade. (a growing trend – this figure was 57% in 2022)


    - The region’s Māori population share has risen and is younger than the rest of
the population (consistent with New Zealand as a whole)


    - While growth in most high-level indicators of economic performance in
Nelson Tasman has been close to national average over the past decade (Table
1), productivity and average household incomes continue to sit below the rest
of New Zealand. Research has shown that if productivity in Nelson Tasman
were to rise to the national average, then this would generate an extra $1.63
billion of GDP and create more opportunities for better paid employment.


**2.2.** **A constantly changing environment**


The ongoing global, national and regional impacts from COVID-19 have delivered
unprecedented shock and uncertainty to our regional economy and community. It
has affected every business in the region in some way; whether through loss of
international visitor spend, shortage of seasonal labour supply, disruption to supply
chains or changing market conditions for our export driven economy. A number of
these impacts are still being felt. In 2022 this was compounded by the impacts of the
August flood event, and we now face the forecast of a recession, inflation and
ongoing economic uncertainty for the period of this SOI. While Nelson Tasman’s
economy has been seen to be performing relatively well in terms of GDP and
employment in comparison to average NZ figures [7], the impacts, resilience and
recovery have been uneven between and within sectors and locations. Furthermore,
this relative performance is not reflected in our living standards – wages and home
affordability have declined between 2021 and 2022. Our average wage is now the
lowest in the country [8] and home affordability is the third worst behind Auckland and

Otago [9 ] These trailing indicators of living standards alongside our chronically low
productivity, highlight the importance of our long-term focus on productivity
improvement, capability building, resilience and attracting investment.


The region remains vulnerable as the world recovers from the pandemic and starts
to feel the impacts of a global economic downturn. NRDA played a critical role in the
region’s economic response to Covid-19 by leading the Project Kōkiri 12-month
action plan to save jobs, get cash flowing, support resilience, and assist the region in
accessing investment from Government to aid our recovery. Going into this time of
economic downturn, the Nelson Tasman Regeneration Plan [10] focus on strategic
priorities remains important. In addition to business-as-usual activity of NRDA, the
COVID-19 disruptions such as lockdowns, restrictions and border closures, and
response support to the floods, demanded new areas of activity and constant
flexibility to respond to changing conditions. The looming economic uncertainty is
expected to make the same types of demands. Our work plan must therefore
maintain strategic, long-term focus, whilst also allowing for some adaptation as
needed. By way of an example, in a typical year NRDA supports around 400
businesses through our 1:1 Business Advisory Service; in the first 12 months following
initial lockdown, we supported over 2,000 local businesses through this service.


**2.3.** **Climate Change**


The government’s target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 30% below 2005
levels by 2030 [11] . As Tūpuna Pono Good Ancestors, it is incumbent upon us all to take
action.


As the lead agency for regional development in Nelson Tasman, NRDA has a dual
responsibility: firstly, to look to our own carbon footprint, and that of our partners,
collaborators and suppliers. Secondly, we must place a climate lens across
everything that we do and encourage others to do the same. Our particular
opportunity is to enhance and foster awareness of where the wins can be most
readily made; to support monitoring and measurement of progress; to connect and
facilitate the actions of others for maximum benefit; and to leverage opportunities
to build in climate action to all suitable regional initiatives.


**2.4.** **Wellbeing**


In 2019 the Local Government (Community Wellbeing) Amendment Bill was passed,
reinstating local government responsibilities for the four Wellbeings – social,
economic, environmental and cultural. Shortly afterwards, the Te Tauihu
Intergenerational Strategy was developed, in which our communities clearly voiced
their requirements for improved wellbeing for our people.


Regional development agencies now embrace wellbeing as part of their remit,
recognising that the purpose of an economy is to serve the wellbeing of its people.
As a CCO, NRDA adopts a shared responsibility with Council to apply a Wellbeing
lens across our work programme and the initiatives in which we engage.


As a local employer, we place the wellbeing of our own people at the top of the
priority list and engage in ongoing professional, team and organisational
development to support that. As the lead regional development agency, we support

the tracking, monitoring and reporting of wellbeing measures for the region, as
committed in the Nelson Tasman Regeneration Plan 2021-2031.


**2.5.** **The Māori Economy**


The Nelson Tasman Regeneration Plan 2021-2031 [12] places a spotlight on Māori
Economic Development, recognising the need for specific focus which is
complementary to our obligations to recognise Tino Rangatiratanga (selfdetermination) under Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The Plan highlights the thriving Māori
economy of Te Tauihu and substantial development potential, a targeted focus on
Māori owned enterprises and Māori entrepreneurs in the region, challenges faced by
a number of Māori businesses, including access to skills, and also opportunities,
including through mandated procurement requirements of government agencies
to Māori businesses [9] . The Regeneration Plan also highlights that underpinning the
thinking behind a focus on Māori economic development is recognition that Māori
are some of the most affected by income disparities, unemployment and household
debt, an inequality that has perpetuated through periods of growth for New Zealand
and have been more exposed in periods of shock.


Diversity can help foster innovation and Māori models of business offer many lessons.
Māori entrepreneurship is a key component of Nelson Tasman’s business
landscape [13,12] . Opportunities exist globally for products whose provenance is
underpinned by an authentic indigenous story. Creating career opportunities for
Māori in key sectors will also help alleviate skills shortages given the region’s Māori
population share is younger and growing faster than the rest of the population [14] .


NRDA will embed consideration of the Māori economy within all our workstreams.


**2.6.** **Our Economic Drivers**


Nelson Tasman has a strong base of longstanding anchor sectors of the economy
that have underpinned our economic performance and prosperity for decades and
aided our recovery from COVID-19 [15] (Table 2 refers).


Manufacturing is the biggest contributor to employment in Nelson-Tasman, closely
followed by Agriculture forestry and fishing. Within these high-level industry
categories are three key production and processing foci – forestry, horticulture, and
the blue economy, all of which have expanded strongly over the past decade,
including through the recent pandemic period. These sectors are also well-aligned
to longer-term structural shifts in global demand towards food and fibre products
which can be produced with relatively more sustainable environmental footprints.


Other key industries of employment in Nelson Tasman include: health care and social
assistance, construction, retail, professional services, accommodation and food
services, and education. Many of these industries have benefited from population and
visitor growth. Some of them are also key enablers that can improve the
attractiveness of the region from a business and liveability perspective [16] .

Our core sectors are rich in potential and ripe for further development:


     - **The Blue Economy**     - 70% of New Zealand’s aquaculture is based in Te Tauihu [17]
and Nelson Tasman is home to Australasia’s largest fishing port [18] . Nelson Tasman
has more than 2,700 jobs in fishing, aquaculture, and processing, which
represents 4.7% of employment, compared to 0.4% nationally. The region,
together with neighbouring Marlborough, is the part of New Zealand with the
highest share of employment dedicated to food production from the ocean. [19]


     - **Food, Beverage & Wellness Products**     - Horticultural crops and processing them
into high-value products represented almost 4,000 jobs in Nelson Tasman in
2021, which was 6.5% of all employment, compared to 2.5% nationally. A
horticultural focus aligns to a trend of ethical consumerism [22] .


     - **Forestry & Wood Processing**     - About 5.0% of New Zealand’s plantation forests
are in Nelson-Tasman, with a similar amount in Marlborough. The region has New
Zealand’s highest concentration of specialist processing, particularly in
laminated and structural wood products [22] . Nelson Tasman is home to one of the
largest MDF plants in the world and produces approximately 10% of New
Zealand’s sustainable roundwood harvest [20] .

     - **Liveability & Our Consumption Economy and Lifestyle** – A “catch all” economic
driver partially driven by our high net migration as a factor of population growth
(91% over last three years [21] ). The COVID-19 pandemic has placed more weight on
lifestyle, which favours regions such as Nelson Tasman where migration has
driven the vast majority of population growth over recent years. Many of the
same factors that attract visitors to the region, also attract migrants.


     - **Research, Science & Technology** – One of our growing strengths with a proud
history of innovation and the highest number of scientists per capita of any New
Zealand city [22] .


     - **The Visitor Economy** – Nelson Tasman has a long history of attracting both
international and domestic visitation. Around 7.3% of jobs in Nelson Tasman
were supported by visitation in 2022, compared to 5.4% nationally [23] . There are
opportunities for the visitor economy to strengthen its linkages to other sectors.
As a ‘shop front’, the visitor sector profiles the region as a place to live and work
and can connect visitors to consuming the region’s other key products (e.g. food
and beverage) when they return home. Although the pandemic, followed by
flood events, has caused challenges for many visitor sector operators in NelsonTasman, the sector has fared better in this region than the national average.
During the pandemic, this was supported by higher domestic visitor spend and
the faster-than-forecast return of international visitors brought December 2022
total visitor spend to 103% of pre-COVID levels [24,25] .


Cutting across our industry sectors are concentrated economic drivers which present
opportunities for expansion and development. These include:


     - **The Knowledge Economy**     - Our intellectual capital that forms the value of so
many of our businesses and allows us to sell knowledge to the world; high valuelow impact economic activities


     - **The Māori Economy**     - Our growing Māori economy, made up of both iwi and
Māori owned enterprises, anticipated to grow substantially over the coming
decade (refer 2.5 above)


     - **The Green Economy**     - The part of the economy focused on sustainability and
environmental restoration, and which includes our businesses who trade off a
reputation for sustainability and care


     - **The Digital Economy**     - The part of our economy enabled by remote working, and
where our lifestyle proposition offers a unique competitive advantage as the
digital economy continues to grow and develop


     - **The Creative Economy**     - From artists and artisans to graphic designers and
writers, supporting a range of careers and businesses in our region and
strengthening the region’s appeal to skilled and talented workers, entrepreneurs
and businesses.


These concentrated economic drivers map well to our core economic strengths. For
example, we are already well known for our success in aquaculture, but the green
and knowledge economies both present opportunities for us to realise further value
from this industry without increasing our footprint. This is an example of where our
regenerative economic strategy helps us play to our strengths and unlock the

hidden potential that exists in the region in a way that enhances outcomes for our
environment and our people.


Likewise, as we look at opportunities to attract residents here who bring their own
job with them and work remotely in the digital economy: whilst we must ensure we
are keeping up with infrastructure demands, this provides opportunities to bring
more external cashflow into our economy which supports our hospitality and retail
sectors. In addition, being able to tap into global opportunities for work will provide
more favourable conditions to retain young people in the region, particularly under
the challenging conditions forecast for 2023/24.


There are encouraging signs that our region is poised for significant advances in
research, science and technology. Our innovation ecosystem is expanding [26], and
more clever businesses are emerging, providing employment opportunities and
supporting our key economic drivers to realise higher value and build resilience to
global changes. Our Science and Technology ecosystem offers a platform from which
we can further develop and attract more companies in this space, supporting the
development of higher value industries and creating more high-paying jobs.


Advances in automation through technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) will
transform some of our key sectors [27.] . Our primary sector is likely to be an early mover
in this wave of change, with opportunities to reduce waste, automate physical
processes and optimise performance across the value chain.


Just as businesses grow through increased sales, our region expands through
increased trade and this requires us to be extremely competitive in global markets
and adaptable to changing conditions. More than a quarter of the world’s economic
output comes from the global flow of goods, services and capital [28.]


A significant amount of our economic growth has been driven by migration into
Nelson Tasman, which has boosted the consumption sector We have a unique
opportunity to focus our efforts on “growing from within”, to play to existing
strengths, to correct some of the structural imbalances in our economy, and to tap
into unrealised potential of our key economic drivers.


**2.7.** **Our Economic Challenges** **[29 30 31]**


The following challenges are apparent in Nelson Tasman’s economic context. These
challenges are also ‘drivers for change’ – things which if overcome could help improve
outcomes for the region:


**Productivity** in Nelson Tasman in 2021 was 21% below the national average
(measured by GDP per job). Low productivity affects companies’ profitability and their
ability to pay higher wages. In addition to contributing to income inequity, and poor
housing affordability, this also perpetuates negative perceptions of Nelson Tasman
as a low wage region, further hindering the ability to attract and retain the right

skilled workers to fulfil key roles [32] .  The reasons for this are both structural and
performance based:


Nelson Tasman has a higher concentration of resources in industries which have
lower productivity than the national average. For example, accommodation,
hospitality, and retailing are more prominent in Nelson-Tasman than nationally (16.7%
share of employment in Nelson Tasman, compared to a 15.2% share of employment
nationally).  The region is also without significant scale in several high productivity
industries, such as information media & telecommunications, financial & insurance
services and utilities.


Across industries, however, productivity outcomes within Nelson Tasman industries
are also generally lower than productivity outcomes within those same industries
nationally. Data shows that 18 of 19 industries in Nelson Tasman had lower
productivity than New Zealand (Table 3 refers). In part, this is due to regional scale
and remoteness, but productivity is also lower than in regions comparable in scale
and distance including Marlborough, Hawke’s Bay and Southland, highlighting the
need for concentrated efforts to unlock potential within our current economic
drivers.


Research has shown that if productivity rose to the national average then the region’s
economy would be $1.63 billion larger (the productivity gap). At historical growth
rates, it would take 123 years for Nelson-Tasman to close its productivity gap with New
Zealand. The region’s productivity growth would have to rise at least twice the current
growth rate nationally to close the gap within 20years. [33]


It is estimated that around three quarters of Nelson Tasman’s productivity gap with
New Zealand could be closed by lifting average productivity within industries, while
the remaining quarter of productivity gains could come from changing the mix of
industries on which Nelson Tasman currently focusses.

**Average household incomes** for Nelson-Tasman are 22% below the national average.
Part of this is because the region has more retirees, but for those still in the workforce
average annual earnings in Nelson-Tasman were 14% lower than the national average
in 2022 ($60,048 vs $69,585). Average wage earnings in Nelson Tasman are the lowest
in New Zealand (marginally below Tairawhiti Gisborne). Higher incomes would raise
living standards and help improve worker retention. As well as damaging the
wellbeing of our communities, low income starves our wider economy of
discretionary spending in areas such as retail and hospitality.


**Constrained workforce availability:** Some 22% of Nelson Tasman’s population is
aged 65+, with a further 15% within 10 years of reaching 65. By comparison, these
proportions are 16% and 12% respectively nationally. The rapid ageing of the region’s
population creates opportunities for some industries (e.g. health care) but will also
create workforce challenges. The availability of workers is already tight, with Nelson
Tasman’s unemployment rate estimated to be 3.5% in 2022, (on par with the national
figure of 3.4%), compared to 4.9% a decade ago. Worker retention, investing in skills
development, automation, and talent attraction can all play roles in solving the
challenge of a shrinking working age population.


**Housing affordability** has declined in Nelson Tasman over the past decade. The
average home in the region in 2021 cost 9.6 times the average household income,
compared to a ratio of 8.7 times income nationally. Renters face similar challenges.
Housing availability is also a challenge. The Nelson Tasman Future Development
Strategy (2019) anticipated the region will need an extra 24,000 homes by 2049. The
housing challenges can affect population flows, which can influence worker


14


catchments and structurally alter commuter flows through the region [34] . As a
proportion of household income Nelson Tasman ranks consistently higher than the
New Zealand average for mortgages: Nelson Tasman people spend 53.8% of the
average income on their mortgage, compared to the national average of 37.5%
(including Auckland) [35.]


**Youth retention and unemployment:** Just 16% of Nelson Tasman’s population is
aged 15 to 29, compared to 20% nationally. Nelson Tasman school leavers have high
levels of educational attainment, and many leave the region for further education and
experiences. A challenge is to encourage youth to eventually return home and to
deepen and market local opportunities to develop a career. While we have historically
had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, our NEET rates continue
to be a concern.


**A highly seasonal industry base:** Nelson Tasman’s horticulture and visitor sectors
are two of the biggest contributors to the local economy – these sectors have highly
seasonal demand patterns and harvesting windows. Seasonality causes extreme
workforce challenges, which border closures have exacerbated. Mitigations can
include investing in automation and improved workforce linkages between sectors
with different seasons to create year-round opportunities.

**Migration reliance:** Some 67% of Nelson Tasman’s population growth over the past
three years was from international migration. These migrants have expanded the
workforce and contributed toward more diverse and multi-cultural communities.
With immigration into New Zealand relatively low at present, partly as a result of
tighter migration settings, there are significant challenges for regions to retain,
attract, and develop their workforces.

**Smaller scale of business and high levels of self-employment** : Nelson Tasman is
dominated by small businesses – 92% of businesses have fewer than 10 employees
and just 1.3% have more than 50 staff. There are also more than 10,000 self-employed
people (17.7% of all employment). Small businesses have less capacity to deal with
change and can be slower than larger and better resourced businesses to adopt new
technologies and other innovations that lift productivity.


**Location and scale:** We are heavily reliant on our port and airport, with a relatively
small ‘surrounding’ population within driving distance spread across a large
geographical area. This also presents challenges for infrastructure funding and
delivery.


**Infrastructure investment to support our population:** With a relatively small
population base and a large geographical area to cover, securing funding for
essential infrastructure to meet the demands of a growing region is a major
challenge. Population growth spread beyond Nelson and Richmond and into
smaller towns and rural areas across the region creates challenges for infrastructure,
community facilities, and connectivity (transport and digital) between places to
enable access to work and education opportunities. As our region grapples with
issues such as sea level rise and more extreme weather events as a result of climate

change, resilient future-proof infrastructure will be essential to the resilience of our

economy.

**Environment and Climate:** The decline of our native eco-systems and the threat of
climate change presents the biggest challenge of our time. Despite the urgency of
climate change action, our emissions have continued to rise. It is incumbent upon
us to be bold and transition to a zero carbon circular economy. In doing so, we must
ensure a just transition, so that where changes need to occur, businesses and people
are adequately supported to transition. This change requires an intensified focus at
a regional level.


**2.8.** **Outlook - Ensuring NRDA is Match-Fit for the Region**


The Nelson Tasman Regeneration Plan 2021-2031 identifies the medium-long term
economic outlook needed to address the region’s economic challenges, with a
strong regenerative focus for our economy, to ensure we are positioned to tackle
these challenges and capitalise on our opportunities.


Our economic drivers highlight the importance that our Regeneration Plan, and
therefore this SoI, must address a portfolio of mutually reinforcing initiatives aimed
to enhance regional productivity, whilst delivering on our regenerative economic
direction and supporting better outcomes in resilience, regeneration and inclusion.


NRDA has grappled with huge change over the past three years as a result of COVID19 and will continue to do so as economic headwinds come to bear. At the same

time as driving and delivering strategy- and insights-led initiatives, we must remain
flexible and responsive to emerging and immediate industry and business needs
and a dynamic economic context.

#### **3. Strategic Framework**


**Our resilient economy allows our people, places, communities,**

**and businesses to thrive**

(Te Tauihu Intergenerational Strategy 2020: Economic wellbeing outcome)


Under this Statement of Intent (SOI), our primary focus is delivery against the Nelson
Tasman Regeneration Plan 2021–2031. Under the Regeneration Plan, and in line with
Council expectations (LoE 2021), NRDA will focus on the following targeted outcomes
over the SoI period:


 - **Regenerative:** The region makes a just transition towards a low-emissions
economy, in a way that mitigates climate change, reverses existing
environmental damage and protects natural resources (land, forests, fresh water,
marine environmental and indigenous biodiversity) now and in the future


 - **Productive:** A shift from volume production to high value products, unlocking
the potential of businesses to thrive, investing in R&D, technology and innovation
to achieve productivity improvements, and supporting small and medium
enterprise development


 - **Inclusive:** More even distribution of economic benefits (recognising that some in
the community fare worse on wellbeing indicators), skills level and productivity
improvements, achievement of higher incomes and the right skills available for
the future workforce


 - **Resilient** : The region is able to respond to and bounce back from disruptions and
shocks in a way that reduces harm and overall costs, sectors are diversified to
reduce risk, there is local provision of many of the goods and services required,
and supply chains are robust.


 - **Creative:** The creative talents of our region are recognised and rewarded, with
opportunities to showcase and leverage our clever businesses, diversity, arts and
artisans, and innovation.


16


The Strategic Framework model (Figure 3.1) summarises the drivers and
opportunities of the regional economy and high-level activity areas to deliver across
the five targeted outcomes. Additional economic development priorities identified
in Council’s LoE will be addressed partly through an integrated approach, considered
in all programmes, and partly through discrete programmes such as targeted sector
support initiatives.


We rely on strong strategic partnerships and collaboration with a shared interest in
unlocking the economic potential of Nelson Tasman. Figure 3.2 presents the
Stakeholder Ecosystem supporting our approach.


NRDA’s full work programme will be underpinned by and aligned with the Nelson
Tasman Regeneration Plan 2021 – 2031 (Project Kōkiri 2.0) – which is strongly focused
on wellbeing, climate resilience and regeneration.


In delivering against these outcomes and priorities, it is important to highlight the
following assumptions:


     - The outcomes of the Te Tauihu Intergenerational Strategy and the Nelson
Tasman Regeneration Plan 2021-2031 touch on a broader range of cultural, social,
and environmental capitals than NRDA’s Strategic Framework model, with many
components to be appropriately led and delivered by others


     - Enabling outcomes may be influenced by factors outside of NRDA’s control,
including national government policy, as well as global and national economic
shocks


     - NRDA will support collective efforts related to improving housing and rental
affordability; therefore there are no outcomes or measures related to this in
NRDA’s Strategic Framework


     - Most activities, and associated outputs/outcomes, depend on partnership and
collaboration, and on NRDA leveraging core funding to secure additional
government / private programme funding.


As we deliver against these outcomes, we will embrace regional themes
identified in the Regeneration Plan [36] :


**We are Intelligent Guardians -- We are Makers and Creators -- We are**

**Clever and Connected**


36 Nelson Tasman Regeneration Plan 2021-2031.


17


**3.1.** **Strategic Framework Model**



18


**3.2** **Stakeholder Eco-system Map**


Our work cannot be achieved alone and therefore we rely on strong strategic partnerships and collaboration with a shared interest in
unlocking the economic potential of Nelson Tasman.


19


#### **4. Strategic Priorities & Activity Areas: What We Do**

The Nelson Tasman Regeneration Plan 2021-2031 [37] and this SoI will be delivered through
the methodology of Project Kōkiri - connecting decision making and sharing knowledge
and resources to unlock our collective economic potential. The Regeneration Plan
brings together a suite of priority strategies and programs, with responsibility for
leadership with the appropriate regional partner.


Under this SoI, NRDA has a dual role in the delivery of the Regeneration Plan: to work
with the Project Kōkiri leadership group to lead the oversight and monitoring of the plan,
and to lead delivery of specific programs within the plan.


Focused on supporting the wellbeing of the people and places of Nelson Tasman,
NRDA’s activity spans strategic economic development, regional promotion and
investment attraction, and business and industry support programs. Our activities will
be delivered through inter-related workstreams:


            Economic Strategy and Innovation


            - Investment Attraction and Promotion


            Business and Workforce Development


            Organisational Management (internal NRDA business; not detailed in SoI)


Our approach is underpinned by working collaboratively, with a strong emphasis on
climate change and economic resilience to ensure Nelson Tasman is in a strong position
to respond to and recover from future shocks and disruptions.


Appendix 8.1 presents the summary three-year work plan for the following activity areas.


**4.1.** **Economic Strategy and Insights**
Leading strategic economic development


NRDA will lead oversight of delivery, monitoring and reporting of the region’s ten-year
Nelson Tasman Regeneration Plan 2021-2031 (the Regeneration Plan), developed under
the Kōkiri Forum. Strong collaboration and partnerships are key to delivering on our goal
of an inclusive and regenerative economy: our economic development activity must be
purposeful, data-driven and strategy-led.

**Key Activities**
Reference: Appendix 8.1 Work Plan


    - **Strategic economic development**     - Leading the oversight of delivery, monitoring
and reporting of the region’s ten-year Regeneration Plan, including facilitation of the
Kōkiri Forum. Facilitating collaborative partnerships and initiatives to advance our
priorities, and championing innovation, resilience and regeneration. 2023/24 will see
NRDA continue to embed productivity considerations into everything (building on
the 2021/22 Nelson Tasman Productivity Project.


    - **Economic intelligence** – Capturing, promoting and sharing economic insights and
data as part of economic monitoring; reporting against the Regeneration Plan
(including wellbeing measures); providing specific data and economic information
to inform stakeholders, key sectors, community and regional policy and planning
considerations.  Directly supporting investment attraction and sector transition and
development, informing all activities under this SoI.


    - **Te Tauihu Māori Economy**     - Supporting uplift and further recognition of the Te
Tauihu Māori economy. In consultation and conjunction with Te Tauihu Māori and
Iwi, this will include supporting the provision of regional Māori business-related data
and insights, and we will strive to align with Toiere. This work will be delivered within
a purposeful engagement and collaboration plan to frame and guide our


37 Nelson Tasman Regeneration Plan 2021-2031 (Project Kōkiri 2.0) (Draft).



20


partnership and activities, and to identify where NRDA focus will most effectively
support and add value to existing work programmes.


Related activities include: Enhancing the Regional Identity to better reflect Māori
storytelling and engagement.

    - **Climate Change -** Alongside our Economic Intelligence outputs we will support the
development of climate action-related data and insights to support regional
initiatives in carbon reduction and offset. We will engage with climate action groups
to explore opportunities for activities and apply climate change criteria to
development projects.


    - **Creative Economy:** Supporting, strengthening and profiling the region’s creative
economy. This will include profile building (within regional positioning/ branding),
and targeted workstream initiatives e.g. visitor experiences.


By 2024 we will have:


    - Led implementation under the Regeneration Plan through the Kōkiri Forum
methodology, maintaining and strengthening a collaborative approach to regional
economic development


    - Become valued advisors for our data and insights on national trends and the
regional economy


    - Supported initiatives to strengthen the Te Tauihu Māori Economy


    - Led regional agency focus on Productivity


**4.2.** **Investment Attraction and Promotion**

Shaping and amplifying our profile, destination story and investment
proposition to attract people, business, and investment


Shaping and amplifying a cohesive destination story, and positioning and promoting
Nelson Tasman, with local support, is one of the most effective tools we have to support
the attraction of talent, businesses, investment and visitors into the region.


We have a strong foundation in our Nelson Tasman regional identity; and we need to be
clever in our approach to regional marketing and storytelling. Campaigns such as the
2020 We’ve Got This / Kei a Tātou campaign [38], and the 2021 ‘We’ve Got You / Mā Tātou E
Awhi campaign’ helped put Nelson Tasman on the map by empowering local people
and businesses with the tools to tell their story in a way that increased local pride and
engaged our whole community. Under this SoI, NRDA will build on this work to enhance
and enrich our destination story to highlight our strengths and showcase our clever
people and businesses to the world. By doing this, we provide the right platform for
attraction and retention activities across all sectors – visitors, talent, businesses and
investment.


Private sector funding in NRDA’s destination activities has historically been relatively
high. However, as seen through COVID-19, this is vulnerable to changes in economic
conditions. A challenge for the SoI period will be identifying a new model of attracting
private sector funding to support our destination profiling and management activities.

**Key Activities**
Reference: Appendix 8.1 Work Plan


    - **Regional Identity & Proposition**     - Positioning and promoting Nelson Tasman as a
destination for the right talent, businesses, investors and visitors. This includes
developing tools and activations for local businesses and community to leverage to
put Nelson Tasman on the map and re-developing the nelsontasman.nz website as
the key destination website for locals, visitors and prospective businesses and
residents.

21


Under the 2021-2024 SoI we will focus our regional profiling and positioning more
strongly to:


    Build Māori storytelling and iwi engagement in our current identity work


    Reflect arts and creativity strengths more strongly in our regional identity work


    Focus on our region’s strengths in innovation, science, research and technology,
targeting business and talent attraction and development, and extending the
current regional identity to give a stronger economic development focus and
application


    Align directly with the Intelligent Guardians focus in the Nelson Tasman
Regeneration Plan 2021-2031, based around wellbeing and climate change


    Focus on positioning Nelson Tasman as a light footprint, low carbon destination


- **Investment Attraction –** Building a dedicated workstream within NRDA focused on
facilitating opportunities for unlocking public and private investment in the region,
including leading and facilitating business case development around infrastructure
and commercial opportunities, and promoting and facilitating investment
discussions.


Profiling the region’s attributes and appeal for investment and talent attraction is a
key part of this workstream; promoting Nelson Tasman as a place to invest and
providing information to prospective investors.


This activity will include focused work to identify and facilitate high impact
investment opportunity, including leveraging the unique opportunities of the
Nelson Tasman science and technology ecosystem and our blue economy to attract
investment, businesses and workers to the region. It is important to note that
investment attraction is not limited to the purely economic aspects such as
infrastructure and commercial opportunities. Investment associated with wellbeing,
climate change and resilience outcomes are within scope.


Investment into business is supported through our Business Advice and Funding
workstream (below),


- **Destination Profiling* -** NRDA will continue to showcase our regional offering to
encourage visitation and consumption of Nelson Tasman experiences and products,
as well as to attract business, investment and talent using innovative and activationled techniques that help put the spotlight on our region. This includes targeted
campaigns, on-going content creation and storytelling, earning the region coverage
through targeted media pitches and increasing our online engagement by growing
our social media presence and (consumer) database.


As international visitation resumes all regions in NZ will be working proactively with
international trade and media. It is important that Nelson Tasman maintains a clear
profile with key international partners. We will seek to leverage opportunities
presented by larger organisations such as Tourism NZ and Air NZ, in order to
maximise the benefits from our investment.


Nelson Tasman will be “a region that is good for visitors” – people come to enjoy and
connect with the region, then leave feeling better than when they arrived. At the
same time, we will attract “visitors who are good for the region” - visitors who come
here enhance the region and these benefits are appreciated by local residents.


NRDA also provides in-region support to visitors through a range of website, maps,
digital promotion and phone contact. In 2022 i-SITE services in Nelson paused; work
in 2023-2024 will determine, with NCC, the appropriate new model for in-person
visitor information support. The 2023.24 SOI does not include funding provision to
support in-person visitor information services.


In 2022-2024 Nelson Tasman will work with Marlborough District Council to promote
and support film industry and investment opportunities in the region.


  - Note: Levels of activity across Destination Profiling will be determined by resources
received/ secured.



22


    - **Strategic Events -** Stimulating visitation and economic value to the region through
delivery of Events attraction, management of the Regional Events Fund (REF), and
management of the Nelson City Economic & Community Events Funds [39] . Aligned
with the NRDA Business Events Programme, activity includes delivering
programmes to build capacity and capability into our local events sector,
coordinating a calendar of events across the region, attracting new events to the
region, and leveraging existing events to support increased visitation and economic
benefit. Events contribute significantly to community wellbeing and community
pride. Council investment in NRDA enables the leveraging of $1.5m in Central
Government supporting for events in Te Tauihu over 4.5 years. In addition, it is
important to include the opportunities for strategic and community events to build
the creative sector where our artists and artisans can extend their reach and

exposure to a wider audience.

By 2024 we will have:


    - Enhanced promotion of our regional identity supporting strategic economic
development messaging


    - Secured an increase in co-investment from Central Government and private
investment in economic development in the region


    - Achieved a better than average growth in domestic (and international where
applicable) visitor spend


    - Supported Nelson Tasman to be recognised as a region focused on low carbon travel


    - Attracted and supported the delivery of diverse and vibrant events to attract out-ofregion attendees


    - Supported Nelson Tasman for film as a partner in the Te Tauihu Film Office


    Investigated / developed a new funding model to support destination management
and profiling in the region.


**4.3.** **Business & Workforce Development (Community and Business)**
Supporting our businesses, key industry sectors, and people to upskill,
innovate and grow


Small to medium businesses are the cornerstone of our regional economy and
community, accounting for over 94% of total business numbers in Nelson Tasman (i.e.
over 12,000 businesses) [40] . The resilience and success of our SMEs is key to our economic
resilience, and due to the changing future of work, the impact of COVID-19 and other
global conditions, our businesses are facing new and increasing pressures.


NRDA has a vital role to play in connecting businesses and people in the region with the
right support, tools and funding to enable them to upskill and grow to meet the
changing needs of business. Supporting the development of the region’s talent pipeline
is also important to support the development of our economy and key sectors and
businesses within it. This includes both retaining and developing talent and skills already
in the region and attracting those with the skills and experience our region needs.

**Key Activities**
Reference: Appendix 8.1 Work Plan


    - **Business Advice and Funding** – Delivering targeted 1:1 support and advice for local
businesses to access business support and funding for management capability
building, R&D and innovation programmes (via Callaghan Innovation). This includes
the leadership, management and delivery of the Regional Business Partners
Programme (RBPP) for Te Tauihu, as a repeat national award winner for
performance and reach, supporting over 200 businesses per year (and facilitating
funding in excess of $1m pa. As well as working closely with many of our regional


39 Funded by NCC separately to core NRDA funding



23


‘frontier’ firms, this workstream also supports our early-stage entrepreneurs, SMEs,
through to our global export companies. Our strategic investment and capability
support-focused programmes are informed through our RBPP programme
insights, centred on productivity, growth and building resilience.


    - **Workforce & Skills Development** – Working with the Regional Skills Leadership
Group, NRDA supports development and delivery of the Regional Workforce
Development Plans and programmes aligned with the region’s labour force and
skills needs. This work programme continues and builds on several successful
programmes hosted/ led by NRDA with Government support in 2021/22 and 2022/23,
including the regional Nelson Tasman Education to Employment Programme and
short term initiatives such as Catch a Job, and Pick Nelson Tasman. In 2022/23 these
programmes were extended to include the Tourism Conservation Employment
Programme. For Nelson Tasman they have demonstrated potential to achieve
impactful outcomes. Under this SoI, NRDA will continue to build these programmes
subject to continued Government funding [41] . This will include continuation of the
Education to Employment brokerage (confirmed funding to 2025), and a new skills
and critical employment coordinator to strengthen the skills pipeline and training
aligned to high value job needs in the region, particularly to support major
developments.


    - **Business Innovation** – Supporting our regional innovation eco-system through the
Mahitahi Colab and aligned initiatives.. The Mahitahi Colab is a strategic partnership
between NRDA, the Nelson Tasman Chamber of Commerce and Te Pūkenga NMIT
and offers coworking (including AI), a business events space (with emphasis on
innovation), and early-stage business support programmes. The co-location of its
three founding partners is central to the success of the Mahitahi Colab, enabling and
fuelling collaboration.


The 2023/24 programme will build on 2022/23, which included delivery of the
Certificate of Applied Innovation, Innovation Nation, NZTech engagement, and
profiling of regional businesses in NZ Entrepreneur.


     - **Sector Transitions and Development** – Connected with other business and

workforce development activities (above), providing focused support to sectors of
competitive advantage and opportunity, supporting collaboration, investment
growth and resilience. This work will include partnership with industry, a ‘cluster’
focus, and alignment with Government’s programme of Industry Transformation
Plans. It will include: Climate change response and regeneration, working with
associated advocacy, sector groups and R&D connections, .


Activities in 2023 /24 will build on 2021/ 2023 work:

         Blue Economy – Advancing development of Moananui, the Blue Economy
Cluster, both as a founding partner of the cluster and through targeted initiatives.
With government funding secured to support development of Moananui, NRDA
will host the initiative and support the establishment of the cluster as an
independent, industry supported entity, with outcomes focused on sector growth
and investment, and with national and international reach. As a partner, NRDA
will work collaboratively with Moananui on key strategic priorities. These include
supporting the investment attraction programme and profiling Nelson Tasman
as New Zealand’s home of the Blue Economy.

         - Food and Fibre* – Identifying and targeting priority industry challenges,
opportunities and environmental changes (e.g. Waimea Community Dam
completion) helping strengthen early-stage food and fibre businesses, helping
build innovation and productivity capability through innovation training
opportunities, supporting primary sectors to address immediate seasonal labour
shortages through capacity-focused projects (as requested by industry), and
working with Businesses for Climate Action to develop tools for businesses in the
Sector to support carbon emissions reduction. * Note: Level of activity will be
determined by resources secured – cluster/ collaboration focus not currently fully
funded.


41 Currently unfunded.



24


         Visitor Sector Regeneration* – The Nelson Tasman Destination Management Plan
(DMP) guides regenerative initiatives to support our visitor sector, placing our
communities, cultures and environment at the heart. It is designed to support
more economically sustainable and resilient businesses while strengthening
community well-being, enhancing cultural pride, addressing needs of climate
change mitigation and supporting biodiversity. Strategies under the Plan focus
on industry careers; light footprint and zero carbon journeys [42] ; attracting highervalue visitors and repeat visitation; smoothing seasonality; supporting sector
recovery from COVID-19; advocating for future facilities to enhance community
well-being and visitor experience; local ambassadors; sub-sector strategies; and
engagement with mana whenua to ensure alignment with indigenous values.
Government funding for implementation of the plan ceased in June 2023.  * Note:
Level of activity will be determined by resources secured.

         Cross sector initiatives, including responding to investment and support
opportunities as they arise on behalf of key sectors


By 2024 we will have:

    - Facilitated high engagement with business development support programmes to
increase business capability and increase regional investment in R&D.

    - Supported a reduction in critical skills shortages across the region and an increased
focus on supporting young people into employment and training.

    - Improved connectivity and communication of regional support programmes for
businesses and people.

    - Enabled greater connection to innovation and business support for Māori
businesses in the region.

    - Continued to support and strengthen the Mahitahi Colab to drive innovation and
collaboration in our region.

    - Supported key industries to commit to improving productivity and to moving the
region towards a zero carbon circular economy.

    - Driven the establishment of an outcome-focused, nationally impactful Blue
Economy cluster.

    - Positioned our visitor sector for regeneration and as a positive contributor to the
local environment, culture and economy.


Note: Visitor sector programme dependency on industry partners programme.


**4.4.** **Our Enabling Priorities Supporting Transition**


This Statement of Intent (SoI) represents a prioritisation by NRDA of regeneration,
inclusion, resilience, productivity and creativity. Collaboration and secure funding are
essential to enable NRDA to deliver on the priorities outlined in this SoI, and to keep
delivery focused on integrated, long-term goals and outcomes.


The 2021-2024 NRDA program will continue to develop and deliver core initiatives which
strategically align with the priorities of the Regeneration Plan In addition, to deliver on
this SoI, we will need to transition to increased focus on:


    - **Strategic framework -** Delivering priorities according to the strategic framework of
the Nelson Tasman Regeneration Plan 2021-2031, and ultimately of the
intergenerational strategy


    - **Data & Insights** – Being strategy led and data driven in our decision-making across
all work areas. Being adaptive to changing economic conditions. Partnering to
deliver specific research projects where funding allows


    - **Communication -** Telling a stronger story about the work of NRDA and our
collaboration partners; Enhancing our stakeholder engagement and the visibility of
our work

Nelson Regional Development Agency Statement of Intent 2021 - 2024, Updated 2022 32


Financial


These financials and the proposed SOI are presented in the following context, including items
informed by the Martin Jenkins Review in November 2020 [51] :


   - **Strained Private Sector Investment**   - The weaker economic climate post the COVID-19
emergency continues to disrupt NRDA’s ability to attract private sector investment.
NRDA has attracted relatively high levels of private sector investment comparative to
other similar organisations (validated by the Martin Jenkins Review). We have been
successful in pivoting somewhat to new private sector funding through targeted
initiatives such as Pick Nelson Tasman and the Catch a Job campaign, however, these
reflect a change in nature of private sector funding to support specific activities (in-out
funding) and not the wider work of NRDA. At the time when this three-year SOI was first
drafted it was anticipated that Nelson Tasman would now be in the COVID-19 recovery
stage, however subsequent lockdowns and restrictions further limited NRDA’s ability to
raise private sector funding over the next two years. The Visitor Sector has been
significantly impacted.


   - **Historically Low Levels of Core Funding**   - NRDA has been operating on low levels of
core local government funding when compared with other similar economic
development agencies [46] .


   - **Imbalance of funding** – NRDA is whole of Nelson Tasman focused. All Government
funding received is Nelson Tasman in scope. The imbalance of core funding support
between Nelson City and Tasman District Councils impacts both the total level of
funding and the dynamic of operations and planning.


   - **Operational Cost Efficiencies**   - The review of NRDA’s operations found that we are
operating relatively efficiently compared to other EDA’s and there was limited room for
a reduction in costs. Nevertheless, we are committed to further investigating
opportunities for efficiencies, within NRDA and with Council.


   - **Central Government Investment** – In 2020/21 NRDA received one-off Government
funding for a range of specific COVID-19 response activities which has now ended.


In May 2022, NRDA secured the continued contract delivery for the Regional Business
Partner Programme 2022-27. This core delivery programme for NRDA supports
innovation and research and development. The Employment to Education contract
funded through MSD is confirmed for 2022/23 only. Opportunities continue to be
investigated to leverage local government funding to secure investment, however,
future Government funding remains uncertain.  Significantly, no further support is
available for delivery of year two onwards of the five-year Destination Management Plan.


Moananui-related Government grant funding received in 2022/23 will be hosted and
managed by NRDA, to be transferred to a new, independent entity once established.
NRDA will continue under Agreement as a founding partner and in-kind funding
supporter of this initiative.


   - **Private Sector Revenue Assumptions:** Budget projections assume Private Sector
funding; 2023/24 Total $112k for Regional Profiling.


   - **Nelson i-SITE:** This SOI assumes no direct NRDA core funding support for an in-person
Nelson visitor information centre/ i-SITE. The review of the i-SITE delivery model in
2021/22 found the model to be financially unviable and not fit-for-purpose for changed
and future visitor needs. The outcome of the review was the decision to temporarily close
the in-person service to allow for the formation of future, contemporary and relevant inperson visitor information support to be determined.


   - **Equity:**   - Unforeseen events over the past two years have highlighted the importance of
NRDA ensuring a strong equity position to ensure organisational resilience.

**6.2.** **Building Long-Term Financial Sustainability**


The combination of the loss of private sector funding and visitor sector income, and an
uncertain future around Central Government support challenges the financial sustainability
of NRDA. To deliver on the aspirations and to build on the momentum of the Nelson Tasman
Regeneration Plan and Project Kōkiri, establishing a sustainable model of future funding in
the long term is essential. Work to identify a private sector funding model to support
Destination management and marketing, is limited in options due to dependency on local
or central Government financial policies. A simplified Visitor sector Partners Programme was
re-introduced in 2022/23. This need for longer term financial sustainability applies across all
NRDA functions.


The 2020 Martin Jenkins review of NRDA’s operations highlighted that one option to increase
core funding that could be assessed is the potential to develop a regional economic
development fund (Regional Economic Investment Fund). Similar funds created elsewhere
have been used to co-invest in business cases and major regional economic development
projects, with work typically led by the local EDA. Apart from bolstering local funding, the
existence of the funds has made it easier to attract Central Government co-investment in the

projects. Consideration of this approach may provide an opportunity for a sustainable future
business model.


**6.3.** **Transition Focus and Resource Implications**


The 2023/24 SOI update reflects progress through the 2021/24 SOI, during a period of
significant economic challenges, funding uncertainty, the need to redirect resources (people
and programmes) to provide response support, and the need to concentrate resource
allocation to priorities and areas of greatest impact.


Councils’ core investment in NRDA 2023/24 will continue to enable significant Central
Government and private investment in the region: Regional Business Partnership Program
(RBPP) funding 2022-2025; Moananui Blue Economy Cluster development grant 2023/25;
Education to Employment (confirmed to 2025); Tourism Conservation Skills programme
2022/24, and the Skills and Critical Employment Coordinator 2023/25. The annually updated
Briefing for Ministers provides a mechanism to present regional investment priorities to
Government.


The 2021/24 SOI and Letter of Expectation drove a transition and expansion of activities and
focus areas for NRDA, including greater focus on long term strategy to enhance economic
resilience, recovery and regeneration, based on clarity of competitive advantage and
strategic opportunities, a strengthened economic insights function, sector support,
targeted investment attraction, support for the Māori Economy, and greater emphasis on
wellbeing, climate change and the creative economy. It reflected a strengthened
collaborative approach to economic development for the region.


The 2023/24 update of the SOI maintains the focus set out in 2021, with progress and
change during the period reflected in the following key areas of resource implications:


   - Unlocking Investment: Continuing to build a workstream focus on attracting public and
private investment to the region through strategic business case development and
positioning (economic development, infrastructure and commercial opportunities).
Following the 2022/23 decision that the proposed Science and Technology Precinct will
not proceed, our investment attraction activity must pivot in 2023/24 in its approach to
promoting investment in this key sector. Leveraging the Moananui Blue Economy
initiative is a key focus.


   - Maintaining a strengthened function in economic profiling and insights, including
regional performance, informing regional planning, and considerations for investment
and commercial opportunity attraction.


34


Financial


   - Targeting key sectors, notably: supporting advancing Moananui, the Blue Economy
cluster; Visitor sector regeneration; Science and Tech-focused investment attraction.


   - Food and Fibre is a priority sector we would propose for greater levels of targeted
support if resourced.


   - Supporting Māori Economic Development remains a strategic priority, however this is
limited by resourcing. Numerous recommendations have been made for a dedicated
Māori economy support role to be based within NRDA to maximise leverage for the
Māori economy from our work programmes; in the Destination Management Plan, in
the RBPP bid to Government, and in strategic advice received. This remains
unresourced. The 2023/24 SOI update reflects this priority embedded as a consideration
across all work areas, rather a standalone focus. It remains an area recommended for
increased capability within the team.


   Government funding to support the Destination Management Plan ceased in 2022/23
placing pressure on programmes to support this sector. At the time the DMP was
written, two further years of funding had been anticipated. This is no longer the case
and the deliverables under the 5 year DMP programme must be revisited as a result. The
sector recovery started later than expected and our Visitors Partner Programme, reintroduced in 2022, is building back but at a slower rate and lower level than anticipated.


   The 2021/24 SOI identified Te Tauihu Film as a new area for focus. It is now recognised
that the ability to resource this activity is highly limited in context of competing priorities
in the constrained funding environment, without specific Council or Government
support.


   In 2022/23 we were hopeful in a bid to secure funding for one of three regional skills hubs
in Nelson Tasman to support the major future construction programme and skills
shortage. This bid was unsuccessful, however the focus on skills and workforce needs
and support is a highlighted priority and in June 2023 we confirmed Government
funding support for a three year Skills and Critical Employment Coordinator role to
support the skills pipeline and training within the region for key high value roles


   The review of the Nelson i-SITE in 2021/22 found the model to be financially unviable and
not fit-for-purpose for changed and future visitor needs. Nelson City Council in 2022
determined to hibernate the Nelson iSITE for up to two years, and as such the 2023/24
SOI update notes that NRDA will work with Council to determine and support the future
model, but there is no dedicated funding for this function.


   - The NRDA Events programme has grown in scale and scope considerably in the past few
years to an unsustainable resourcing level. The 2023/24 programme will be adjusted, in
consultation with Nelson City Council, following a functional analysis underway at the
time of the SoI update.


   - Opportunities for operational efficiencies will continue to be investigated with Council
staff.


Staff remain NRDA’s biggest asset, and retention and support remains a priority


Note Moananui project funding through MPI SFFF is not included in the 2023/24 SOI based
on the assumption that grant funding will transfer to an independent entity in Q1.

#### **7. Governance Statement**


Governance of the NRDA is the responsibility of the NRDA Board. Operations of the NRDA

organisation are the responsibility of the Chief Executive who reports to the Chair of the
Board.


**7.1.** **Procedure to be Followed with Purchase of Shares in Other Company**
**or Organisation**


The procedure to be followed before subscription for, or purchase of, or other acquisition of

shares in any company or organisation, shall be by resolution of the Directors, excepting that
any significant diversification or addition to existing activities will be referred to the
shareholder for approval.


**7.2.** **Directors Estimate of Company Value**


The Directors estimate that the opening balance of shareholder funds in the annual accounts

will represent the value of the Company. The Directors will advise the shareholder on an
annual basis if they believe the value to differ materially from this state. The opening balance
of equity projected at 1 July 2023 is $265,661. The projected ratio of consolidated shareholder
funds to total assets at 1 July 2023 is 19%.


Based on the nature of the NRDA’s business the shareholder accepts no dividend is required

to be paid to the shareholder as a result of the company’s activities.


**7.3.** **Accounting Policies**


The NRDA Accounting Policies were reviewed by the board in November 2022 following the

2021/2022 audit report and found to be complying with the Tier 2 Public Benefit Entity Public
Sector (“Tier 2 PBE PS”) Financial Reporting Framework and all audit requirements. A full set
of the reviewed policies are available from the NRDA as required.


**7.4.** **Capital Expenditure and Asset Management Intentions**


Based on the business model assumption the capital expenditure estimate for 2023/2024 is

$172K. This will assist in the delivery of expected outcomes and will be primarily allocated to
redevelopment of the nelsontasman.nz website and digital assets, which is scheduled for
2023/2024


**7.5.** **Health & Safety**


Directors and Officers (the CE) have obligations under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015

regarding staff, contractors and visitor. NRDA has a policy, supported by a process, to:


   - Be informed and keep up to date about work health and safety matters


   - Identify hazards and risks associated with NRDA operations and take steps and
processes to eliminate or minimise those risks


   - Ensure NRDA has appropriate processes for receiving and considering information
regarding incidents, hazards and risks and for responding to these in a timely way


   - Ensure NRDA implements processes for compliance and verifies all the above steps.

**7.6.** **Risk Management**


The current uncertain economic climate poses many potential risks to the successful delivery of this SoI. We will focus on high levels of

engagement and communication with key stakeholders and best practice Governance approach outlined in section 7 and apply these
principles while monitoring and assessing risk.


Key programme related risks associated with organisational ability to deliver against this SoI in 2022/23/24 are resource related. While

shareholder core funding is confirmed to June 2024, future Government funding is not confirmed

**7.7.** **Sustainability and Climate Change Responsiveness**


In alignment with the Te Tauihu Intergenerational Strategy and the Nelson Tasman

Regeneration Plan, the NRDA recognises that climate change is a significant challenge to
the future of NZ and the regional economy. We acknowledge the transition required to a low
emissions economy, and the need to address the significant challenges presented by climate
change. NRDA embodies a lens of climate change mitigation and adaptation in all its
activities. NRDA has sustainability at the heart of the organisation’s approach to all its
activities.


**7.8.** **Organisational Sustainability**

**8.2.** **Appendix 2: Investment Across Activities**


A high-level percentage breakdown of investment across functional activities proposed for

2023/ 2024 is provided in the chart below. Monitoring of this investment across activity areas


will be included in all performance reports to Council. This highlights regional development


investment achieved through local government funding.


Project delivery funding will be constrained without Government support for Destination


Management Plan delivery, the early stages of reintroduction of the Visitor Partners


Programme. Staff core operating and committed programme costs represent more than


90% of funding and therefore we will be reliant on raising funds to support programmes.
